## Side Note Non-compete agreements
Non-compete agreements are often used specifically for competitor companies to prevent employees from joining or starting a competing business after leaving their current employer. These agreements aim to protect a company's trade secrets, confidential information, and competitive advantage.

In Massachusetts, non-compete agreements are enforceable under certain conditions. Massachusetts has specific laws governing the use of non-competes, including requirements for duration, geographic scope, and consideration provided to employees. It's essential to be aware of and comply with the specific regulations in the jurisdiction, as they can vary from state to state.

Nonetheless, the primary intent behind non-compete agreements is to restrict employees from engaging in activities that would directly compete with their current employer's business, particularly when moving to a competitor. These agreements are not typically intended for broader restrictions unrelated to competition.
