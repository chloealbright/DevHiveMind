Navigating equity and stocks in startups requires a clear understanding of the terms involved. Here's a refined note to help clarify these concepts:

# Equity & Stocks

**Understanding Stock Options:**
In the startup realm, equity often comes in the form of stock options. It's crucial to distinguish between shares and stock options. Stock options are not immediate ownership but a commitment to buy shares at a predetermined price (strike price) in the future.

- Exercise occurs when the share value surpasses the strike price.
- Some may convert options to shares pre-liquidity event, but it involves financial risk.
- Vesting is common, usually over four years with a one-year cliff.

**The Reality of Ownership:**
Contrary to the notion of being "owners" in startups, stock options are not ownership. They provide an option to buy stock at a set, often inflated, price, which can be challenging for many employees to afford.

# Evaluating Equity in Tech Jobs

**Significance of Equity:**
Equity distinguishes tech jobs, symbolizing ownership that aligns employees with the company's success. For senior roles, equity can be a substantial part of compensation.

- Vesting typically spans four years, with possible equal monthly/quarterly/yearly distributions.
- A vesting cliff sets the minimum time before equity becomes available.
- Until an IPO or acquisition, equity may not hold tangible value.

**Types of Equity:**
Different companies and stages offer various equity types: stock options or stock grants (RSUs).

- Stock Options: Given by mid-stage companies, these allow purchasing at a fixed strike price.
- Stock Grants (RSUs): Immediate ownership, sellable during defined trading windows for public companies.

**Considerations for Stock Options:**
Understanding stock options involves recognizing the exercise window and planning for departure expenses.

**Navigating Stock Grants (RSUs):**
Stock grants, like RSUs, grant immediate ownership, and can be sold during specific trading windows for public companies.

# Salary Evaluation and Negotiation

**Approaching a Raise or Promotion:**
When discussing a raise or promotion, inquire about the appropriateness of the timing. Acknowledge economic constraints but also consider inflation.

- Discussing performance reviews and equity can be part of the conversation.
- Understand the context and inquire if there are specific reasons for the timing being inappropriate.

By understanding the nuances of equity and approaching negotiations strategically, you can make informed decisions and effectively communicate your needs.
