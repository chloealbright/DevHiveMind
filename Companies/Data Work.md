## Describe Data in a Meaningful Way 

The data should be described using business language, such as the attributes, related events, mappings of the values, example values, business rules, etc. An enterprise business glossary should be established to ensure each business term or acronym has a consistent definition for an organization. Appropriate categorizations and classification of data elements can further enhance the data descriptions. In other words, data should be described in a common language that anyone can understand and relate to what it represents. 

## Describe Data with Context and Data Flows 

As data are transmitted across systems, they quickly become entities on their own. Data Architecture should be the first level of documentation to put data in a business context  

all the data’s contextual information should be documented, including use cases, data sources, data collection methods, data transformation rules, related references, etc. Any data has its origin. All data should be created or curated with a use case or purpose (e.g., cleansing, standardization). 

The documentation should come along with the data as promoted through the development life cycle with the code, programs, and packages. In other words, data are not static but fluid. Describing data in the context of data flows related to other data is essential for complete and accurate understanding. 

## Establish Disciplined Data Management to Manage Meta-data Systematically and Consistently 

For an organization with hundreds and thousands of data sets, it needs Data Catalog and Data Governance to manage and centralize the data definitions effectively. Data Catalog captures and stores metadata, descriptions, data categorizations, and classifications of all data assets.  

Data governance is to enforce data defining processes. The maturity of data catalog and data governance directly correlates with the degree of efficiency in a data organization to make the data well understood, trusted, and leveraged.  

The lack of it leads to waste of resources due to confusion, excessive time spent in meetings to grab information, data duplications, unnecessary errors in the data, and black boxes of data as treated by business users.  

Furthermore, as an organization matures in data governance, documenting the data by working directly with the Data Catalog should become a habit for everyone who works with or uses the data, ultimately leading to a happy business community given the transparency to trust the data provided to them. 

## Data Scientists and Data Analytics Professionals Connect Data with Business 

Data scientists and data analytics professionals (e.g., product managers, data analysts) have become widely popular in recent years, who understand data from their initial sources throughout the solution processes to solve business problems. 

Their responsibilities are similar to what a scientist does, to design the experiment, collect the data, perform the data analysis, and draw the conclusions. With this said, scientists have the hypothesis first and develop the data collection methods accordingly. It is not that easy in the business world due to the disaggregation between IT, who collects the data, and business departments who use them.  

Data can sometimes be collected without a purpose, or the data can sit somewhere without being understood or used.  

Data scientists, product managers, and data analysts play the role of bridging the gap by documenting the data, championing the data architecture, leveraging the data catalog, supporting data governance, and ultimately enabling the business to discover and realize the potential value of the data fully.
