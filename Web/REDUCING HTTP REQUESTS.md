CHECK FOR 404 ERRORS

404 errors are quick to get. Check your pages with your browser’s

“Dev Tools” to make sure all of your requests find their target!

CHECK FOR (UNNECESSARY) REDIRECTS

Redirects are costly because they cause HTTP requests. Make

sure you’re only redirecting when absolutely necessary!

CONCATENATE CSS & JAVASCRIPT

Combining multiple resources in one output file saves expensive

HTTP requests. Make sure you don’t deliver too many CSS and

JavaScript files!

COMBINE IMAGES IN SPRITE FILES

Instead of delivering each graphic asset in its own file, you can

bundle them in a single file. “Image Sprites” help reduce HTTP

requests and are ideal for smaller graphic files like icons and

logos.
