### Coding Challenge
#todo/Perpetual/Dev
- [ ] Use jamboard for sharing and explaining alternative to Miro  
- [ ] Use Microsoft for planning and coding challenges alternative to Miro Outside of interviews^[Microsoft word office supports Pen on tablet]  
### Constraints
- [ ] Relax constraints solve problems you want to solve within the problem or alternate problem that is similar or close to the original

### Feature check
- When learning a new feature/technology or library  think about how commonly used and at what stage of the development process or Codebase contribution process will it be used at to decide on the time you give to it in terms of the breath and depth 
	- like if your deciding to go in depth into something you may do it immediately or in the future like with java class loaders or loggers
- or over the long term like learning all the different Java versions in-depth or at least in breath over time in small chunks
