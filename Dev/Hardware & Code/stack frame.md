a method call or initialize a variable add it to the stack then pause and give control of the stack to the next line of code to be added to call stack which is the stack frame. the next thing added is the  param  if there is one then the next values in the actual method including other variables and other lines that may update the variable adding things to the stack and give control to the next stack frame until everything is done and we are at the return and everything is popped off the stack  

the stack frame is basically a method call 

CPU register points to blocks of memory in call stack 

In computer architecture, the CPU register holds the key role which is small data holding place or memory and is an integral part of the processor. It is a very fast memory of computer mainly used to execute the programs and other main operation quite efficiently. Register basically used to quickly store, accept, transfer, and operate on data based on the instructions that will be immediately used by the CPU. In memory hierarchy of a computer registers the top place and is the fastest in manipulating the data. Numerous fast multiple ported memory cells are the atomic part of any register. 

stacks allocate memory once at the beginning heaps does it multiple time  

maximum memory is allocated at the bottom while the minimum at the top  

hackers go after return statements in the call stack to mess with code
