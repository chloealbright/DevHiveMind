### Try
```javascript
const log = (level, message, ...context) => {
  try {
    const logMessage = `${new Date().toISOString()} [${level.toUpperCase()}]: ${message}`;
    console.log(logMessage, ...context);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error occurred while logging:', error);
  }
};
```



To account for different data structures and log their values, you can update the logging function to handle various types of data structures. Here's an updated version of the code:

```javascript
const log = (level, message, ...context) => {
  const logMessage = `${new Date().toISOString()} [${level.toUpperCase()}]: ${message}`;

  context.forEach((item, index) => {
    console.log(`Context ${index + 1}:`);
    console.log(item);
  });

  console.log(logMessage);
};
```

In this updated code:

1. The `log` function still accepts the log level, message, and additional context as parameters.

2. The log message is constructed with the current timestamp, log level, and message, as before.

3. The `context` parameter is an array that can contain different data structures to be logged. Each item in the `context` array is logged separately.

4. The `forEach` method is used to iterate over each item in the `context` array. For each item, it logs a heading indicating the context number (`Context 1:`, `Context 2:`, etc.) and then logs the value of that item.

By updating the code in this way, you can log different data structures passed as context parameters alongside the main log message. This provides flexibility to log specific values or data structures for debugging or analysis purposes.
