1. **Initialize a Hash Map**: Create an empty hash map to store the indices of elements.

2. **Loop through the Array**: Iterate through the given array of numbers.

3. **Calculate Complement**: For each element in the array, calculate the complement by subtracting it from the target.

4. **Check if Complement in Map**: Check if the complement is already present in the hash map.

5. **Return Indices if Found**: If the complement is in the map, return the indices of the current element and the complement.

6. **Store Current Element in Map**: If the complement is not in the map, store the current element along with its index in the hash map.

7. **Handle No Solution**: If the loop completes without finding a solution, throw an error indicating that no valid solution was found.

8. **Example Usage**: Use the function with example arrays and targets to verify its correctness.



```typescript
function twoSum(nums: number[], target: number): number[] {
    // Step 1
    const numMap: Record<number, number> = {};

    // Step 2
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        // Step 3
        const complement = target - nums[i];

        // Step 4
        if (complement in numMap) {
            // Step 5
            return [numMap[complement], i];
        }

        // Step 6
        numMap[nums[i]] = i;
    }

    // Step 7
    throw new Error("No valid solution found");
}

// Step 8: Example Usage
const nums1 = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const target1 = 9;
console.log(twoSum(nums1, target1)); // Output: [0, 1]

// Repeat Step 8 for other examples...
```

These steps provide a structured approach to understanding and implementing the given solution in TypeScript.



Certainly! Let's break down the process in a more high-level, non-technical manner:

1. **Prepare for Tracking**: Imagine setting up a system to keep track of numbers and their positions.

2. **Look Through the List**: Go through the list of numbers one by one.

3. **Find a Pairing Strategy**: For each number, figure out another number that, when combined, equals the target sum.

4. **Check if You've Seen It Before**: See if you've encountered this special number before in your journey.

5. **Declare Success if Found**: If you've seen it before, celebrate! You've found two numbers that add up to the target.

6. **Remember for the Future**: If this special number is new, make a mental note of it for future reference.

7. **Express Failure if Nothing Works**: If you go through the whole list without finding a solution, admit that it seems impossible in this case.

8. **Example Scenarios**: Test your system with a few scenarios to make sure it's working as expected.

This approach provides a more abstract view of the steps involved in solving the problem without delving into technical details.



Certainly! Let's categorize the steps into CRUD-like operations:

**Create:**
1. **Prepare for Tracking**: Initialize a system (variable) to keep track of numbers and their positions.

**Read:**
2. **Look Through the List**: Iterate (read) through the list of numbers one by one.
3. **Find a Pairing Strategy**: Read each number and determine another number that, when combined, equals the target sum.
4. **Check if You've Seen It Before**: Check if a specific number has been encountered before.

**Update:**
5. **Declare Success if Found**: If you've seen the special number before, update (declare) success by returning the indices.
6. **Remember for the Future**: If the special number is new, update (remember) it for future reference.

**Delete (or Handle Failure):**
7. **Express Failure if Nothing Works**: If there's no solution, handle failure by throwing an error.

**Example Scenarios (Test):**
8. Test the system with example scenarios to make sure it's working as expected.

This categorization aligns the steps with CRUD operations, emphasizing actions related to creating, reading, updating, and handling failures or deletions.
