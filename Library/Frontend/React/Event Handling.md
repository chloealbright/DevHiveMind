use react hooks along with classes and components hooks are react specific can't be used with JavaScript much if at all and you shouldn't call inside condition loop or nested function  

you can build hooks  

first, practice redux to understand how it works 

Redux toolkit helps deal with the repetitive behavior of redux 

https://redux-toolkit.js.org 

Redux in general takes inspiration from database management 

try and combine redux, react classes and react hook functionality to work together 

switch case statements are good for handling a lot of conditionals but sometimes in your could there might be a better approach instead of having a lot of  conditions it all depends 

use redux logger for debugging the state 

don't just add libraries and frameworks determine whether it is needed first
