Typed languages are the languages in which we define the type of data type and it will be known by machine at the compile-time or at runtime. Typed languages can be classified into two categories: 

	Statically typed languages 
	In computer programming, a static variable is a variable that has been allocated "statically", meaning that its lifetime (or "extent") is the entire run of the program.


	Dynamically typed languages 

**What actually mean by static type language(High or performances/compiled): 

	type of a variable must be specified  

	a variable can reference only a particular type of object* 

	type check for the value will be performed at the compile time and any type checking will be reported at that time 

	memory will be allocated at compile time to store the value of that particular type 

	TypeScript provides a command-line utility tsc that compiles (transpiles) TypeScript files ( . ts ) into JavaScript. However, the tsc compiler (short for TypeScript compiler) needs a JSON configuration file to look for TypeScript files in the project and generate valid output files at a correct location. 

	In a compiled language, the target machine directly translates the program. In an interpreted language, the source code is not directly translated by the target machine. Instead, a different program, aka the interpreter, reads and executes the code. 

	Statically typed languages: each variable and expression is already known at compile time. 

	(int a; a can take only integer type values at runtime) 

	The types are checked before run-time so mistakes can be caught earlier. 

	Examples: C(Weak), C#(Strong), C++(Weak), Java(Strong), GO(Strong),  Typescript(Strong) 

	Typescript is a superset of JavaScript meaning it has things that JavaScript doesn't have and everything JavaScript has and it  compiles down to JavaScript  adding features of statically typed languages to JavaScript which is Dynamically weak 

**Dynamically typed languages: variables can receive different values at runtime and their type is defined at run time. 

** What actually mean by dynamic type language: 

	no need to specify type of the variable 

	same variable can reference to different type of objects 

	The types are checked during execution. 

	(var a; a can take any kind of values at runtime) 

	Examples: Ruby, Python(Strong), JavaScript(Weak) Bash(Weak)

Statically typed languages have better performance at run-time and are faster at run-time. It is because there is no need for type checking at run-time, and the code has already been translated. But dynamically-typed languages are comparatively faster during development time and are more flexible.


Low-level programming languages are those that are closer to the hardware and provide direct access to system resources like memory and registers. These languages are typically more difficult to use and require a deep understanding of computer architecture, but they offer fine-grained control over system resources and are often used for developing low-level software such as device drivers, operating systems, and embedded systems.

Medium-level programming languages are those that provide a balance between low-level control and high-level abstraction. These languages are often used for system-level programming, scientific computing, and numerical analysis. They are typically easier to use than low-level languages but still provide direct access to system resources.

High-level programming languages are those that provide a high level of abstraction from the underlying hardware, making them easier to use and learn. They typically provide features like garbage collection, object-oriented programming, and dynamic typing. High-level languages are often used for developing applications, web development, and data analysis.

The distinction between low, medium, and high-level programming languages is not always clear-cut, and there is some overlap between the categories. Some languages may be considered low-level for some tasks and high-level for others. Additionally, different programming languages within the same category may have different levels of abstraction and control over system resources.


Alot of Procedural programming languages look like they both static strong and weak medium level  languages
