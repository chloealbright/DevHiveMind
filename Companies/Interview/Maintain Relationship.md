## **Scheduling a Meeting with Boss's Boss:**

When scheduling a meeting with your boss's boss to gather information and showcase initiative, frame your request as a genuine desire to familiarize yourself with a specific topic. Seek feedback on aspects they are invested in, demonstrating genuine interest. After the meeting, express gratitude for their time and information, and propose a follow-up meeting in a month or two to provide an update on your progress.



## **Utilizing Previous Manager's Feedback:**

When interviewing for another company after a layoff, loop in your previous manager who you have a positive relationship with. Ask them for feedback and potentially have them provide positive input to the new hiring manager. This can strengthen your candidacy and create a positive impression.



## **Performance Review as References:**

Save copies of your performance reviews for future reference. These documents can serve as valuable references for prospective hiring managers, showcasing your skills, achievements, and contributions in previous roles.
