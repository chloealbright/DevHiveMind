# What to Think & Ask About

## Analyzing Data Structures/Types/Constructs
- When examining an algorithm, identify the data structures, types, and constructs used.

## Identifying Weak Points
- Understand the potential weaknesses in these data structures.
- Develop an execution plan to address these weaknesses.







## Sort Algorithm Boundary Cases
- Potential scenarios where sorting algorithms may fail:
  - Empty input
  - Input with only one element
  - Very long input
  - Garbage inside the collection to be sorted
  - Null input
  - Duplicate elements
  - Collection with all elements equal
  - Odd/even length input

## Understanding Overlapping Cases
- Consider how these boundary cases may overlap or relate to each other.
