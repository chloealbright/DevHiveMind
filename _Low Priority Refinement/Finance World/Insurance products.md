New York Life Insurance offers various insurance products that can be purchased in addition to life insurance. Some of the additional insurance options provided by New York Life Insurance include:

1. Long-Term Care Insurance: This type of insurance helps cover the costs associated with long-term care services, such as nursing home care, assisted living, or in-home care. It provides financial protection in case you require extended care due to illness, disability, or aging.

2. Disability Income Insurance: Disability insurance offers income protection in the event you become disabled and are unable to work. It provides a portion of your pre-disability income to help cover your expenses while you're unable to earn an income.

3. Annuities: New York Life Insurance offers annuity products, which are financial contracts designed to provide a guaranteed income stream during retirement. Annuities can help supplement your retirement savings and provide you with a steady source of income after you stop working.

4. Critical Illness Insurance: Critical illness insurance pays a lump sum benefit if you are diagnosed with a covered critical illness, such as cancer, heart attack, stroke, or organ failure. This insurance can help cover medical expenses, treatments, or other financial obligations while you focus on recovery.

5. Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance: This insurance provides additional coverage in the event of accidental death or serious injuries resulting in dismemberment (such as loss of limbs). It pays a benefit to the designated beneficiaries or the insured in case of covered accidents.
