**Agile Frameworks and Practices:**
- **Spike:** A research proof of concept in Jira.
- **Regular Agile:** Follows the hierarchy: Epic > Feature > Stories. User stories are detailed and succinct, following a well-defined template.
- **TDSA - TD SAFe Agile:** Hierarchy is Theme > Feature > Epic > Stories. User stories are created and added to the product backlog before the sprint backlog.

> **[!important] Oli is there to address blockers and help move things like hitting up PL. Close issue clone if it is crossing into a new sprint also comment.

**Knowledge Management:**
- Knowledge management is conducted in Confluence.

**Planning:**
- PR planning for platforms (not practices). TD has adopted and done it for the practice or practice construct.

**Stakeholder Considerations:**
- If you have multiple stakeholders in a story, they may have different or misaligned acceptance criteria.
- Clone and close when work is done for stories; otherwise, if no work is done, move over.

**User Stories and Personas:**
- User stories can have multiple personas.
- Examples of personas are presented, followed by the statement, "I want to..."

# **Pi Planning:**
- Approximately 46 story points of work needed for each PI.
- Only 6 story points of work near PI planning.
- Move backlog to Epic for the next PI.

**TD Bank's Non-Standard Fiscal Year:**
- Pi planning occurs across four quarters: Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, each spanning three months.
- Regular fiscal year Q1 starts in January and follows a 3-month increment until Q4, which starts in October.

# **Requirement Lifecycle:**
- **Business Requirements:** High-level needs, wants, and objectives driving product development.
- **Features:** High-level changes for customers, less than a year, breaking down into 3-month Epics and further into small user stories for 2-week sprints.

> **[!note] Completed Epics get converted into features aligned with themes.

# **Epics in Depth:**
- OKRs are converted into epics with themes.
- Epics have acceptance criteria.
- Features are detailed and programmable.
- Epics can span 1-2 sprints or the entire quarter.

> **[!note] Continuous improvement epic may be created for improving existing features.

# **Shirt/Sprint Size:**
- XS, S, M, L, XXL sizes defined based on sprint duration.
- Stories larger than XXL may need to be broken into two epics.

# **Split a Story:**
- Criteria for splitting a story provided, addressing conditions, workflow steps, happy path vs. alternative paths, and more.

# **Use Cases vs. Stories:**
- Stories focus on who, what, and why.
- Use cases provide detailed process flows for users with in-depth guidance.

# **Attributes of Requirements/User-Story:**
- Cohesive, complete, consistent, correct, modifiable, unambiguous, feasible, and testable.

# **Acceptance Criteria:**
- Criteria developed at the beginning, middle, and end of creating a story.
- Written from the product perspective, defining scope and serving as one of the definitions of done.

# **Definition of Ready:**
- Ensures understanding and agreement within the team before moving a story forward.
- Various considerations to think about before getting a story ready.

# **Definition of Done:**
- Checklist of completion activities for a given user story.
- Criteria include code review completion, meeting acceptance criteria, resolving dependencies, executing test cases, and deploying to the target environment.

# **Estimation:**
- Old way vs. new way of estimation discussed.
- Relative estimation involves team voting to get a more accurate estimate.
- Importance of clear communication and understanding during estimation to avoid padded estimates and unrealistic timelines.
