If documentation is very complex or involve write the reason why it was created and what things are optional and not optional and stuff

especially with TD because some might nigh attempt to look if something exist and end up doing duplicate work 


or they maybe multiple documentation that is  similar but doesnt provide why it was created why each step is done and what is it doing also if a step is optional or required 

but sometimes people dont read too
