1. Ride Zum:  
- Is basically an uber for kids and parents  
- It drivers that drive your kids from school to home or from home to school  
- This way it solves the problem for parents that have to get to work and don’t want to but their kids on public transportation  
  
Notes:  
- To sign up, you have to go through a thorough background check, car check, and driving history, and even interview.  
- Because you’re dealing with children.  
  
Pay:  
- You can make anywhere from $16-$35 per hour  
- And if you ask me that’s pretty solid  
- You can pick and choose the rides you want, according to the money you’ll make  
  
Btw: Honestly I wish we had this when I was growing up. It's a pretty good idea.
