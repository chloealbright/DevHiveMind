## For limit order use when
- You want to specify your price, sometimes much different from where the stock is
- You want to trade a stock that’s liquid or the bid-ask spread is large (usually more than 5 cents)
- You’re trading a high number of shares (for example, more than 100)

## For market order use when
- You want a quick execution at any cost
- You’re trading a highly liquid stock with a narrow bid-ask spread (typically a penny)
- You’re trading only a few shares (for example, less than 100)
