An SDET plays a dual role, combining aspects of both developers and testers. They originated at Microsoft and are now common in major tech companies. SDETs automate tasks to enhance efficiency and reliability, engaging in both White Box and Black Box testing. Unlike manual QA testers who focus on application behavior, SDETs delve into inner workings for automation tests. Their interviews typically involve test case creation, coding exercises, system design questions, and HR discussions. The goal is to ensure a comprehensive understanding of testing facets and the ability to contribute to software quality.
