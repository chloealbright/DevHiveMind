The runtime of functions that take in regular expression (regex) strings can vary based on factors such as the complexity of the regex pattern, the size of the input data, and the efficiency of the regex engine used by the programming language or library.  
  
In general, simple and well-optimized regex patterns tend to have faster runtimes, while complex or inefficient patterns may take longer to execute. Additionally, the length and structure of the input data play a role in the overall performance.  
  
It's important to consider the specific implementation details of the regex engine being used, as different programming languages and libraries may employ different strategies for regex matching. If performance is a critical concern, profiling and testing with representative data sets can help identify potential bottlenecks and optimize the regex usage.


### Debugging Regular Expression

Debugging regular expressions can be tricky, but there are some helpful approaches you can take:

1. **RegexBuddy**: If you’re working with regexes frequently, consider investing in **RegexBuddy**. It’s a powerful tool that includes a built-in debugger. You can create, test, and debug complex regular expressions. [While it’s not free, the time saved can be well worth the cost](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2348694/how-do-you-debug-a-regex)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2348694/how-do-you-debug-a-regex).
    
2. **Online Tools**:
    
    - : This web-based tool allows you to interactively debug your regex patterns. It provides a visual representation and helps you understand how your regex matches specific strings.
    - **regex101.com**: Another excellent online resource with a debugger. It lets you step through your regex and see how it behaves with different inputs.
    - **Visual Studio**: If you’re using Visual Studio, set a breakpoint near your regex code, switch to the ‘Immediate window,’ and test your regex using `Regex.IsMatch(yourDebugInputString, yourDebugInputRegEx)`. [This can help you quickly identify issues](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2348694/how-do-you-debug-a-regex)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2348694/how-do-you-debug-a-regex)[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1137437/what-tools-are-there-for-debugging-stepping-through-a-regular-expression).
3. **Built-in Methods**:
    
    - Use `RegExp.prototype.test()` if you only care about whether the regex matches a string (without capturing groups).
    - [For finding all occurrences of a global regex, use `String.prototype.match()` (again, without capturing groups)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/exec)[3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/exec).

Remember that testing your regex thoroughly with various input cases is crucial. It will help clarify your intentions and make debugging easier. Happy regex hunting!
