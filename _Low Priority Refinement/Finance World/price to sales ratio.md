dont use on financial firms or asset intensive sectors like investment trust or property investment companies for those you might want to look at price to book



it hard to evaluate growth stocks in the case of cloudstrike when a company doesn't have any earnings yet and you cant use pe ratio we use price to sales ratio which is the  
  
market cap / revenue of last 12 months  
  
this shows how much the market values each dollar of the companies sell this basically acts as substitute of the pe ratio also lower is better especially below 1  
  
ps ratio is good to use for saas(software as a service) companies  
also use rule of 40 which is growth + profit percent if the sum is over 40 you have a good stock  
  
financials  
  
look at revenue growth from past years  
look at total cost of revenue in the case of cloudstrike it increased which is fine because revenue grew but it didnt grow in proportion to there revenue increase which means they have good margins saas companies are known for having good margins tho so dont over rely on this look at other stats before making descesion  
  
look at net loss in the case of cloudstrike it was 25,382 in 2019 going down to 19,222 meaning things are getting better and there getting closer to profitability  
  
  
look at current ratio which is  
  
current assets / current liabilities if above 1 your doing good  
check overstock when there sheets come out for 2020  
  
  
look at deferred revenue which is under liabilities it is basically services that have been payed for but not yet delivered yet meaning there are liabile for it until they deliver service once service is delivered then it will be added to revenue also this number in the case of the subcription service of saas companies like cloudstrike isnt particularly a problem beacuase if a client is doing an annual subcriptions the months that are left in the subscriptions would be considered as a liability also try to subtract deferred revenue from total liabilities to build a highpatetical picture  
  
check the percentage of deferred revenue in comparison to liabilitly total  
  
sells arent profit
