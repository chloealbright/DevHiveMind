- **Definition:** The knapsack pattern refers to a class of optimization problems where the goal is to find the optimal solution from a set of choices, considering constraints on capacity or other factors.  
- **Applications:** It is commonly used to solve problems like the 0/1 Knapsack problem, fractional knapsack problem, and other problems where you need to make a sequence of decisions to optimize some objective function.  
- **Implementation:** The knapsack pattern can be implemented using either tabulation or memoization, depending on the specific requirements of the problem and the preferred approach.
