## Why Engineering  

### Path 1

  
Software development process is like being given partially built puzzle with a box of blank white puzzle pieces and your expected to put the pieces together without knowing how the final picture looks like because your creating picture that doesn't exist and the process of creating that picture can be very chaotic and it is your job to bring order and structure to bring all those pieces together to create a master piece.


Building software is like getting a half-finished puzzle with blank white puzzle pieces. You're basically creating a picture that doesn't exist, and the whole process can be a bit chaotic and you have to take all those pieces and bring order and structure to all that chaos to create a master piece.



Developing software is a bit like getting a puzzle with half-finished and blank white pieces. You're essentially crafting a non-existent picture, and the process can get pretty wild. Your job? Tame the chaos, organize those pieces, and turn it into a masterpiece.



### Path 2


  
Martial arts because there are both forms of high-level problem-solving one just involves you getting hit in the head and losing a couple of brain cells but you put yourself in a chaotic situation where you need to face and analyze a problem that dynamically changes as you try and break it down in small pieces and solve.


and I always compare martial arts to programming  
  

  
so I decide on programming it was challenging almost like a video game and  
I also like because it reminds of mma because when it comes down to it is high level problem solving but without to worry of getting punched in the face  
  
and with mma there is alot of variables it almost like its own program were you have two programs with there own built in functions


I view software development as high-level problem solving and consider it similar to martial arts because both are disciplines that require discipline. You have to be almost all those things and willing to learn more. And I believe I carry these attributes because I always try to be better by lapping my past self in a race full of obstacles and problems to be solved.Â
