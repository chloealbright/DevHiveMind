**Optimal Techniques for Different Scenarios:**

**Binary Search on Sorted Array:**
- Use binary search by focusing on the middle of the array.

**Handling Sorted Arrays:**
- For sorted arrays, consider techniques like binary search.
- Two-pointer approach can also be effective.

**Linked Lists:**
- When dealing with linked lists, the two-pointer and fast-slow methods are handy.

**Recursion Restrictions:**
- If recursion is not allowed, turn to stack-based solutions.

**Dynamic Programming:**
- In dynamic programming, use stacks when solving problems related to maximum/minimum subarrays, subsets, or scenarios like matching parentheses questions.

**Heap Data Structure:**
- Heaps are useful when you need to find top or least K items.
- Priority queues, often implemented with heaps, are valuable in Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path, fetching the next best or worst element, Huffman coding for lossless data compression, Best First Search, and Minimum Spanning Tree scenarios.

**Working with Strings:**
- For common string operations, consider using maps or tries.

**BFS vs. DFS:**
- BFS is faster for trees with significant depth.

**Graph Problems:**
- DFS is suitable for tasks like topological sorting, maze-solving, finding strongly connected components, generating words in order, checking path existence. It uses less memory but can be slow.
- BFS excels in shortest path problems, copying garbage collection, serialization, finding the closest node, when the tree is deep, and solutions are rare. It's also preferable if you know a solution is close to the root, although it uses more memory.

**Shortest Path Algorithms:**
- Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford are essential for solving shortest path problems.

**Backtracking:**
- If asked for all permutations or subsets, consider backtracking. This method is typically used for problems like Sudoku or chess on grids.

**Cyclic Sort:**
- Cyclic sort is suitable for sorting when given numbers from a range (1 to n). It swaps corresponding values in place but may not fully sort arrays with missing numbers in their range.

**Merge Intervals:**
- The merge interval technique is useful for handling scheduling or interval problems, like scheduling classes or meetings, organizing memory data, or task scheduling in operating systems.

**Scenarios for Sorting Algorithms:**
- Various sorting algorithms are best suited for specific scenarios, like insertion sort for sorting schools by distance, radix or counting sort for eBay listings by bid amount, quick sort for sorting scores on ESPN, merge sort for massive databases, insertion sort for almost sorted Udemy review data, radix or counting sort or quicksort for temperature records, quicksort for large, random user name databases, and bubble sort for teaching sorting.

**General Optimization:**
- Hash maps are often the key to improving time complexity in various coding scenarios.
- Hash tables and precomputed information (e.g., sorted data) are excellent for code optimization.
