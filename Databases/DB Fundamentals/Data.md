## Data definition  

facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis. 

Factual information (such as measurements or statistics) used as a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation 

Information in digital form that can be transmitted or processed 

Information output by a sensing device or organ that includes both useful and irrelevant or redundant information and must be processed to be meaningful. 

### Everything mentioned about data refers to information  

#### Information is defined as  

1.a Knowledge obtained from investigation, study, or instruction 

1.b The attribute inherent in and communicated by one of two or more alternative sequences or arrangements of something 

1.c.1 A signal or character (as in a communication system or computer) representing data 

1.c.2. Something (such as a message, experimental data, or a picture) which justifies the change in a construct (such as a pen or theory) that represents physical or mental experience or another construct 

1.d A quantitative measure of the content of information 

2. The communication or reception of knowledge or intelligence. 

By comparing the two definitions, we can derive that information is more useful than data. Information is created and used via communication after the data is studied and analyzed. On the contrary, data need to be collected first to represent a group of facts and then processed to provide meaningful information. In the end, information is stored and manifested by the data, in various ways, only when it offers insight, knowledge, and value.




Cardinality refers to the number of unique values in a relational table column relative to the total number of rows in the table. The Cardinality of a column is assessed and stored in system tables for optimizer use when the database administrator (DBA) runs statistics. 

We have data and it will grow change over time be shared be fast be searchable be reliable in terms of accuracy and uptime also interdependent, consistent, protected and secured 

A database isn't just for storage as the above has stated 

Also data is structured in different ways and there's a lot of planning that goes into it structure and particular ways 

Companies have many databases representative scopes of data 

An index is a internal map in DB between the primary key and other tables and there relationships
