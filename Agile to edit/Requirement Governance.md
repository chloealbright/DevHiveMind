  
## Defining Requirement Governance  

| Traditional Approach                                 | Adaptive Approach                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| All requirements defined upfront                     | Enough detail for delivery and feedback     |
| Set phase gates                                      | Frequent reviews                            |
| Official reviews and sign offs                       | Oral, team agreements                       |
| All development is held to the approved requirements | Changes happen after delivery               |
| Changes are formally submitted and tracked           | Feedback become new requirements            |
|                                                      | Priority is constantly reviewed and updated |
|                                                      | Approvals on delivered functionality        |



  
## Example Governance for Traditional Approach  
  
  
All requirements must be verified and validated before review  
  
Requirements go through formal review process with team  
  
  
Business owner signs off (approves) requirements  
  
Any requirements changes are then submitted using change request form  
  
Changes are analyzed before approved or denied by business owner  
  
  
  
  
  
## Example Governance for Adaptive Approach  
  
  
Any requirement is defined and put into the backlog  
  
Team and product owner agree on prioritization based on value  
  
Highest priority requirements are implemented  
  
Feedback on delivery are captured as new requirements in backlog  
  
Bi-weekly review of backlog and corresponding backlog




## Maintaining  Requirements
Requirements are "required" well after implementation  
  
Requirements emerge on a continuous cycle  
  
Leveraging tracing and version control  
  
Reusing requirements as baselines


## Presenting Requirements Changes
*You are NOT the decision maker *
*You present recommendations*

- Change: Add functionality to feature  
- Why: Easier usability  
- Potential ROI: Increased revenue (from increased user adoption)  
- Risks: More intensive to build, requires additional resources  
- Impacts: quantify the risks (potential impacts) like Increase to budget, schedule delayed or changed due to resources

### Alternatives:  
  
1. Not change feature  
	- No change in ROI, risk missing out on additional revenue through customer frustration  
  
2. Change technology platform  
	- Ability to offer more features, increased revenue but increased cost and time  
  
Recommendation: Implement small change to functionality and wait for solution delivery and feedback for further changes

## Changes in Adaptive Requirements
| Changes          | Risks                            | Impacts                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Change a feature | Other features are not delivered | Lower ROI and delivery of value  |
|                  | Delighting the customer          | Higher ROI and delivery of value |
|                  |                                  |                                  |



## Changes in Traditional Requirements


| Changes          | Risks                                       | Impacts                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Change a feature | Requires more time to complete than planned | Requirements must be reworked    |
|                  |                                             | Resources need to be rescheduled |
|                  |                                             | Delivery of solution delayed     |
|                  | Requires additional resources               | Budget increase                  |
|                  |                                             | Delayed schedule                 |
