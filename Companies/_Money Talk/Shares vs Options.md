Depending on the maturity of the startup, you may be offered “equity”. Most likely that equity will come in the form of stock options. It’s important to highlight the differences between shares and stock options:  
  
Stock options are not shares, they are a contracted promise to buy shares at a predetermined price (strike price) in the future.  
  
  
You typically exercise that promise at a sale when the value of the shares is higher than your strike price.  
In rare cases, some employees will exercise their promise to convert their stock options into shares before a liquidity event (exit/sale). They must have the cash handy, and be ok with the risk of shelling out hard-earned money for a company that is still bleeding VC cash. The only upside is that you become a real current shareholder.  
  
It’s also important to know that in all cases, the startup won’t give you all the promised stock options at hire. Your “equity” will likely face a vesting period of four years with a one-year cliff.  
  
One of the biggest lies in startups is that employees are “owners” in the companies they work for.  
  
Stock options are not ownership. They’re an option to buy stock at a set price, which is typically inflated and most employees simply can’t afford.


# Equity & Stocks

Equity is what differentiates a tech job from a non-tech one. Equity means a share of the company; this signifies ownership and motivates employees to work in the best interests of the company. They can be a significant portion of one's compensation, sometimes even more than the base salary, especially for senior employees.  
  
Equity usually vests (becomes available to you) over a period of time (typically 4 years) and can vest equally every month/quarter/year. A vesting cliff means the minimum period of time before your vesting begins. For example, if you are granted 4,800 shares over a 4 year schedule with a 1 year cliff, and monthly vesting, you will get 1,200 shares at the end of your first year and 100 shares every month thereafter for the subsequent 3 years.  
  
Until the company goes public (IPO) or gets acquired, the equity is usually not worth anything. However, there are instances where you can sell your stocks internally even though the company hasn't gone public. Be mindful of what you are getting yourself into!  
  
Not all equity is treated equally. Depending on the company you join and which stage that company is at, you may receive one of the following types: stock options or stock grants.  
  
Stock options#  
Stock options are typically given by mid-stage companies. Stock options are different from stocks, which represents the immediate ownership of a company! Stock options are the option/right to purchase stocks at a given strike price, hence it's not free. However, the cost of each stock is usually quite low and fixed at a strike price, which is equal to the fair market value of the stock when it was granted to you. You are guaranteed to be able to purchase the stock at that price regardless of future increases.  
  
When you leave a company, there is an exercise window (deadline given for you to exercise your options before they are gone), so it is important to have enough liquid cash to purchase them when planning a departure.  
  
Stock grants#  
A stock grant is commonly referred to as a Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) and it means you possess the stock immediately. If the company is public, you can sell them during defined trading windows.

In terms of evaluating my candidacy for a raise or promotion  
  
Ask would it be appropriate to discuss something like after they give you a price or range that you aren't comfortable with like talking about performance reviews or whatever else like equity  
  
Also give them a little bit more power by saying that you understand about the current economy and the constraints but you also got to consider inflation  
  
If it is not appropriate ask why wouldn't it be appropriate to do this in this time especially
