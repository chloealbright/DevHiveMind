<p>
Pure Boolean check with UPDATES or no UPDATES needed in terms of what the question is asking but UPDATES can be included depending on the approach you come up with or if the question requires it. Also READ is doing some type of access so be aware of that when creating conditional logic because you optimize your READ

<p>
Typically involves READ/UPDATE functionality  which can be also considered as CREATE/DELETE when it comes to UPDATE process and depending on the question and your approach can include CREATE and/or DELETE

Talk about code Modularity instead of implementing focus on just creating a working solution and you can refactor or talk about refactoring after

When thinking about Modularity think about which section of the code can be reused for other things

## Focus on these interrogative pronouns  

### Try and compress 

- ##### What(broadest question of them all) refer to things - identify the different scenarios/edge-Cases and dependencies   
	- Use **what if questions** for edge cases and using the edge case to figure out what the question is asking. you can rephrase it saying `"can I assume this or that …"` 
	- The focus of these question should be on the edge case  


- ##### Why - identify the root overall or at specific scopes 
	- Can be asked in different ways `"Is there any reason this wouldn't have... "`


- ##### How - identify the steps  
	- This is used after you collect information as define steps you will order them appropriately

<p>
Look for obvious checks at pre then post then in the middle and then utilize truth table comparing conditions using the results from table determining which conditions get separated 
</p> 

<p>
If test cases size exceeds two conditions or you use else if think about breaking out into helper function 
</p> 

<p>
Check attributes if num of param greater than one what is being compared if parms are of two array or different Data Structures lean more towards brute force approach especially if problem is complex and specific do `iterative` coding style else you can go a `declarative` 
</p> 

<p>
Think about pre or post computing input/params. Is there a way that you can reorganize the data (`sorting algo`, etc.) or compute some values upfront that will help save time in the long run? and Don't hyper focus on the output too much basically check if input is in a particular order like sorted, partially sorted, and unsorted and see if you can sort as a optimization changing how you traverse(some or every element) beginning/end of data structure or which algo pattern is used or can be ruled out as you render down problem 
</p> 

<p>


You can simplify or tweak some constraint or input, such as the data type. Then, we solve this new simplified version of the problem. Finally, once we have an algorithm for the simplified problem, we try to adapt it for the more complex version.

         Pre-Condition: at beginning of something 

         General-Conditions: usually inside loop 

         Termination-Conditions: outside of loop or even inside or beginning  

         Post-Conditions: after loop 


Think about how would you test define utilization and over-utilization basically how something should be used and shouldn't be used and how code can be scaled  

identify  use cases, situations, and scenario, bounds and constraints, stresses and failures conditions, and set limitations

## Decision table   

Look at all the cases you have and create a long list trying to understand how they overlap and which conditions will be true or false most of the time (which is known as Short circuit Evaluation) especially if combining two or more  condition checks together 

think about different rules and combinations from the input to the output  

decision are the input and actions are the output

***Reordered and organize Steps*** while thinking about modular functional pieces that can include things like Boolean functions that check something. ***Render that down into BIG ABSTRACT steps that can be rendered down to sub steps ***

Explain trade-offs, poke holes in logic,  and how the code/approach can be improved if given more time typically at end of working or semi solution. 

Between questions and writing code ask if you can get a minute to think in silence by saying ok interesting can I have a little time to think just limit time keep it like 45-sec shift to another mental tab 

You don't need to code everything if you can mention there might be a cleaner or better way to make it more readable or optimal by refactoring certain parts you could just describe that

### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">⬇ Code if stuck check past steps and Identify Runtime and potential BUD or Optimizations 15 min or less </mark>

When optimizing identify BUD and think about BIG O Processes like Access, Search, Insertion, and Deletion 

And the data Structures associated with them  basically doing a Data Structure Brainstorm also think about past problems that may be similar  

- If stuck, think about related problems you have seen before and how they were solved. 

- If you have to explain a lot of stuff and steps about your code you should probably change your approach. Also If you can't think of naïve approach do a BruteForce or If you have a naïve maybe talk through a BruteForce initially. 


- Solve a simpler version of the problem. Remove or simplify one of the requirements of the problem. Once you have a solution, see if you can adapt that approach for the original question. 

- Solve problem "incorrectly" and then think about why the algorithm fails. Can you fix those issues?   

- Look for any unused info.  


- Start with an inefficient solution. Even if it feels stupidly inefficient, it’s often helpful to start with something that’ll return the right answer. From there, you just have to optimize your solution. Explain to your interviewer that this is only your first idea, and that you suspect there are faster solutions.
