## Understanding the Stock Market and Financial Metrics:

### Stock Market and Company Future:
- The stock market reflects the future of companies, making it an avenue for investing in their growth and improvement.
- Buying stocks translates to ownership in a company – owning shares equals a percentage stake.
- Stocks raise capital for companies, providing liquidity for investors. Liquidity is crucial for easily converting assets into cash without affecting their value.

### Company Capital Structure and Shares Issuance:
- Creating a company often involves issuing shares to raise capital. Share prices impact liquidity and can be influenced by stock market issuance.
- Capital represents the total resources supplied to a business by the owner – the difference between assets and liabilities.
- Return on capital measures gains after using invested capital, including revenue and other factors.

### Revenue and Profit Analysis:
- Revenue is money generated by selling goods or services.
- Net income is the amount kept after covering costs, expenses, and taxes.
- Profit margin is calculated as net income divided by revenue, providing a percentage – a higher margin is generally favorable.

### Financial Metrics:
- Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: Calculated as stock price divided by earnings per share (EPS).
- Earnings Per Share (EPS): Calculated as net income divided by the annual share count.
- Earning Yield: Calculated as EPS divided by stock price – a measure of return on investment.

### Dividend Yield and Valuation Indicators:
- Dividend Yield: Calculated as Dividend per Share divided by Share Price.
- Evaluating dividend trends over five years helps determine stock valuation.
- Key Indicators for Investment:
  - EPS above 8%, consistent growth in earnings and dividends.
  - Examine the company's products, lasting competitive advantage, and recession resistance.
  - Check low debt (under 70%), good credit rating (S&P BBB+), P/E ratio below 25%, and P/B ratio below 3%.
