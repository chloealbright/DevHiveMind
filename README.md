<div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Dev Journey Knowledge Repository </h1></div>

## Overview
This Software Development Knowledge Repository is a centralized and organized collection of information on various software development topics. It's designed to be a valuable resource for developers, both experienced and beginners, as well as anyone interested in the field.

## Key Features

- **Topics Coverage**: The repository covers a wide range of software development topics, including programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, best practices, Architecture, and more.

- **Markdown and Obsidian**: We use Markdown for creating and formatting our notes which us . [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a knowledge management app, is our primary tool for managing and editing our notes. It allows us to create new notes using customizable Markdown templates, link related notes, and create a network of knowledge.

Markdown is considered a plain text format. It is designed to be human-readable and easy to write, while still allowing for the conversion to structured documents (e.g., HTML, PDF) with the help of rendering engines or parsers. Markdown documents are essentially plain text files with simple formatting conventions, making them a popular choice for writing documentation, README files, and other types of text-based content that need to be easily readable and writable.

- **Mindmaps**: To provide a visual representation of knowledge, we use mindmaps to connect related concepts and topics. Mindmaps can help users navigate through the repository and understand the relationships between different subjects.

## Making it Public

The goal is to make this knowledge repository public to benefit the broader software development community. By sharing our insights, best practices, and solutions, we aim to help others learn, solve problems, and improve their software development skills.

## Contribution and Growth

I encourage contributions from the community. Here are some best practices for maintaining and growing the repository:

- **Updating Existing Notes**: Contributors can update existing notes to keep them current by adding yourself as a author and update the "EditDate" property.

- **Creating New Notes**: When creating new notes, use Markdown templates to maintain consistency in formatting. Obsidian can help with this using custom templates by pressing `alt + n`. You can create your own templates to suit specific note types or add templates that you found effective.

- **Adding Authors**: Include yourself as an author or attribute authors to the respective notes to give credit for contributions. It's important to acknowledge and appreciate the work of contributors.

- **Status and Categorization**: Use note properties or tags to categorize notes by status (e.g., refinement, done, perpetual, or create status that make sense) and topic. This helps users quickly find relevant content.

- **Sharing Personal Experience**: We also believe in the value of personal experiences. Contributors are encouraged to share their real-world experiences in companies and teams. These stories can provide valuable insights, lessons learned, and tips for navigating the industry.

- **Draft Pull Requests (PRs)**: If you decide to fork an initial project for your repository, consider using draft PRs for contributions. This allows contributors to collaborate on changes before merging them. It's a good practice for maintaining transparency and ensuring that everyone is on the same page.

## Benefits

By maintaining this public repository and following best practices, we aim to:

- Share knowledge and best practices.
- Create a community of knowledge sharing.
- Help newcomers and experienced developers alike.
- Foster collaboration and growth in the software development field.

With a well-organized repository, Markdown templates (including custom and found templates), the power of Obsidian, the inclusion of personal experiences, and draft PRs, we can create a dynamic and evolving resource for the software development community.

Feel free to customize this template further to align with your specific goals for the software development knowledge repository.

## Disclaimer

In this repository, you'll find an assortment of Markdown files encompassing various subjects, along with my personalized Obsidian setup, complete with plugins and custom configurations. To ensure that your contributions don't inadvertently disrupt these customization's during pull requests, You can alternative: establish your own Obsidian repository where you can maintain your personal notes.

Once you believe your contributions hold value and are ready to be integrated into this main repository, simply fork it and append the specific note. This method allows you to circumvent the inclusion of your individual Obsidian settings and plugins, which may diverge from those in this repository. Employing this approach streamlines the pull request process and expedites the merging procedure and allows you to have your own custom Obsidian setup if wish to.

>Prior to introducing new information, it is essential to perform a comprehensive review to ensure there are no pre-existing or related documents that could be integrated or cross-referenced. When utilizing content generated by ChatGPT, exercise diligence in order to prevent inaccurate documentation. It is equally important to strike a balanced approach and steer clear of over-documentation.
