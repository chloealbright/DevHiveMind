#### Overview of Build Automation 

### Background 

Let’s think back on the DevOps pipeline.  One of the eight stages of the DevOps pipeline is Build.  One of the DevOps practices is Continuous Integration (CI).  Before CI can be achieved, Enterprises must first understand how to automate the software build. 

The software build converts source code files into software artifacts that the computer can run.  It is an end-to-end process that consists of version control, code analysis to ensure code quality, and compilation to turn source code into executable files that machines can read. 

Let’s revisit the tasks associated with the Build stage. Once the developer has submitted their code to the version control system and it has been merged for a new codebase, an automated build will occur. This automated build involves creating a repeatable, standardized process for compiling source code into binary code, packaging binary code, running automated tests, and updating the version control system. 

Before automated builds, software development teams would stitch together their applications in each environment.  So when the application was deployed from dev to test to prod, the configurations would be inconsistent.  This caused a slowdown in productivity due to conflicts and duplicate efforts and even halted deployments. 

### Purpose 

An Enterprise’s goal with build automation is to recreate the entire production environment based on what is in version control. To achieve this goal, Enterprises must utilize automation.  Enterprises will need to create scripts, and the configuration information should be stored in the version control system.  This should be a self-service system with no manual work required from human intervention. 

#### Benefits of Build Automation 

There are several benefits Enterprises can gain by utilizing build automation.  These include: 

- Increased productivity so developers can focus on delivering more value. 

- Improvements in quality because issues are found and resolved faster. 

- Maintains a historical record for investigating issues. 
  

The aforementioned benefits lead to the ultimate benefits of saving time and money.
