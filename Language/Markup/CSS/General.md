## Refinement:

### Structure of CSS:

CSS comprises a selector, which can be a tag, ID, class, or an advanced selector. Within the declaration block, various properties and values are assigned to the selected element within the HTML.

### CSS Selector:

The CSS `element>element` selector is utilized to target elements with a specific parent. For instance:

```css
div > p {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

- **Explanation:**
  - This targets `<p>` elements that are direct children of `<div>` elements, setting their background color to yellow.

- **Select All:**
  - The `element>element` selector is specifically used to select elements with a defined parent. To select all instances of an element, you would use a simpler selector, such as just the element name (e.g., `div`).

- **Nested Class Access:**
  - For nested classes, you can chain selectors, such as `.red .green`, to access elements with the class `.green` nested within an element with the class `.red`.

### Additional Resources:

- For a comprehensive guide on CSS selectors, you can refer to [W3Schools' CSS Selectors Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp).

- For best practices regarding inline styles in React.js, you can explore discussions on platforms like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26882177/react-js-inline-style-best-practices).
