if you Windows 10 after Linux disconnect Linux drive then reconnect the drive after installation and do an update grub

$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:rodsmith/refind

$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install refind

If you're installing Linux on your desktop know that you might not be able to boot into windows again because you might get bootloader issues or grub bootloader stuff issues

When reinstalling Windows on desktop used 1803 on drive and format to fat32
