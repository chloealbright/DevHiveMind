It is **Elastic** adapting to changes in workload usually dynamically & for short term like maybe dealing with an increase in web traffic  

It is **Scalable** giving you the ability to add resources to handle increase in workloads which is usually more static & long term an example of this is scaling up your database because size is growing 

It has **High availability** meaning the ability to continue functioning even if some components fail  like when a power outage happens & a data center goes down traffic is re-routed to another data center  

It has **Reliability** like for example having 99.99% of uptime for EC2 instances during a given month basically the ability to function consistently and correctly when expected   

Then there is **Agility**, giving you the ability to develop, test & launch a new app in days instead of months  

Global reach, pay as you go pricing for resources, & economic scale  where cloud services like AWS can purchase things more cheaper than us  

In general when buying certain things in life like for example a car there is a TCO(Total Cost of Ownership) which is a combination of Upfront cos(Capital expense)t & cost to operate cloud eliminates the CapEx & helps reduce OpEx  

You can reduce cost of cloud by Right sizing meaning operating with the right amount of resources needed  by automating certain behavior like reducing networking resources when expecting low traffic, 

also **compliance scope** which has deal with any actions dealing with data like people credit card info, reporting of certain data or depending on the law and the service you provide and the data generated & used can affect if you can copy & move data. 

You can  also can use managed services(for example, RDS, ECS, EKS, DynamoDB) instead of building up services  

### Cloud Architecture Design Principles  

Design for failure 

Decuple components  

Implement elasticity  

Think parallel
