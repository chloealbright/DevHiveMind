If you understand how to deploy applications to the real world, you will be able to assist your team from the coding phase until a feature gets tested and deployed  

Understand the full software cycle: Continuous Integration  

Specialisation: React, GraphQL, and the “hottest” tech out there  

At this stage, you developed a strong understanding of the core principles of software development. It is time for that extra step that will make you stand out. Specialization will allow you to stand out from other hundred developers claiming expertise left and right.
