Firstly, there is generalized learning in artificial intelligence, where it assimilates information from its surroundings. For instance, when outside, it collects data such as weather conditions, lighting, dimensions, and other relevant factors to adapt and respond to different situations.

Following this, the AI engages in reasoning, involving the evaluation of a set of choices to make informed decisions based on the acquired generalized learning. This process allows the AI to select the most suitable option.

Ultimately, problem-solving is a crucial component, where the AI applies its knowledge and reasoning abilities to address challenges and find effective solutions.

These three elements collectively constitute artificial intelligence, providing the system with the capacity to adapt, reason, and solve problems. There are two main categories of AI: weak AI, which focuses on specific tasks like playing games such as Go, and strong AI, which represents more advanced AI, akin to the self-aware robots portrayed in movies, introducing an element of unpredictability.

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, utilizes artificial intelligence to further enhance its capabilities. Machine learning, in turn, is a subset of artificial intelligence. The integration of machine learning in AI is instrumental in minimizing errors and optimizing performance, often leveraging technologies such as GPUs and DLSS in Nvidia GPUs for enhanced efficiency.
