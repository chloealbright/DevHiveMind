This reverse interview helped me make that decision. I learned that although it was a risky move to move a part of Payments to Amsterdam, they did so as the first few Uber engineers also moved here, carrying lots of influence. After my manager told me this, I asked to talk with one of these engineers - Jordan, Uber employee #5 and the first mobile engineer. He was a straight shooter with both the good, the bad, and the ugly, which I very much appreciated. 

Asking about your future manager from a future peer is an underrated move that gives you far more information at this phase, than you can typically gather throughout the interview process. It's what I did, and questions I asked included these: 

What do they like and dislike about their manager? Who would be my future manager. 

Who did they last promote on the team, and why? 

Who left the team, and why? 

How supportive are they, as a manager?
