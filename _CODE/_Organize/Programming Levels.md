## Programming v Software Engineering
### Programming(Micro)

Programming is like giving instructions to a computer to make it do things. Imagine you have a very obedient robot, and you need to tell it what to do step by step. You use a special language (programming language) to write these instructions, and the robot (computer) follows them precisely. These instructions can be anything from making a game, calculating numbers, or even browsing the internet.  
  
### Software Engineering(Macro)
Software engineering is like building a complex structure, but instead of bricks and mortar, you're creating computer programs (software). It involves a structured and organized approach to designing, creating, and maintaining these programs. Just like architects plan buildings, software engineers plan how a program will work, write the code (the instructions for the computer), test it to make sure it works correctly, and keep it updated and running smoothly.  
  


# There are Levels 

## Level 1
Level 1 topics may not require extensive testing initially. Instead, start by attempting 1 or 2 questions to identify problem areas and guide your study efforts. There's no need to spend excessive time on questions you know nothing about. For level 1 topics, focus on curating a list of troublesome areas and invest time in researching and studying those specific areas. In some cases, you may spend an entire week on research before tackling questions, especially for complex subjects.

For challenging topics, attempt a question at the end of the week after a week of focused research. The goal isn't to answer it correctly but to place your studies in context. Study the solutions thoroughly to understand problem-solving techniques. Add questions you got wrong to your 'wrong' pile for retesting later.

## Level 2:
Level 2 topics strike a balance between research and testing. Maintain a structured approach: identify problem areas, research, test, study solutions, evaluate, and retest. Emphasize doing questions to advance to level 3.

Challenge yourself to take action â€“ doing questions is key to advancing to level 3.

## Level 3
Level 3 signifies comprehensive knowledge. It's all about practice: test, review solutions, retest questions you got wrong, and refine your expertise.



## Changing Levels:
Be flexible with your level assessments. If you see improvement, move to a higher level. Conversely, if a topic becomes challenging or your solutions are suboptimal, move it down a level. Trust your judgment and adapt your approach as needed.

In summary, for effective learning, assess your proficiency objectively and adjust your study approach accordingly. When learning a concept in English, plan and understand it thoroughly before translating it into code.
