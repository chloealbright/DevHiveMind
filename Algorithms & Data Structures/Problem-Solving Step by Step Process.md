Most examples are too small or are special cases. Debug your example. Is there any way it's a special case? Is it big enough? avoid special cases  

Test your code-on paper. This means testing the general cases, base cases, error cases, and so on. You'll need to do this during your interview, so it's best to practice this in advance.  

Type your paper code as-is into a computer. You will probably make a bunch of mistakes. Start a list of all the errors you make so that you can keep these in mind during the actual interview.  

**follow with BUD(Bottlenecks Unnecessary Duplicated work) optimization technique to reduce and eliminate things  

	Look for any unused info. You usually need all the information in a problem.  

	Solve it manually on an example, then reverse engineer your thought process.How did you solve it?  

	Solve it"incorrectly" and then think about why the algorithm fails. Can you fix those issues?  

	Make a time vs. space tradeoff. Hash tables are especially useful!  

	Use a fresh example. Sometimes, just seeing a different example will unclog your mind or help you see a pattern in the problem.  

	Precompute information. Is there a way that you can reorganize the data (sorting, etc.) or compute some values upfront that will help save time in the long run?  

## Walk Through  
Go through your algorithm in detail and get a feel for the structure of the code. Know what the variables are and when they change. Make sure you understand each detail before you start coding make sure that you get it as close to "perfect" in the beginning as possible.  

If you don't understand exactly what you're about to write, you'll struggle to code it. It will take you longer to finish the code, and you're more likely to make major errors.
