Fidelity, one of the well-known investment firms, offers a range of options for IRA transfers and rollovers. Here are the common transfer and rollover options available through Fidelity:

1. Direct rollover: If you have a retirement account with a previous employer, such as a 401(k) or another IRA, you can initiate a direct rollover. Fidelity can help you transfer the funds directly from the existing account into a Fidelity IRA. This method avoids any tax withholding or penalties and allows you to maintain the tax-advantaged status of the funds.

2. Indirect rollover: With an indirect rollover, you receive a distribution from your current retirement account, and then you have 60 days to deposit the funds into a Fidelity IRA. However, there are some important rules to consider with an indirect rollover, including potential tax withholding and the risk of missing the 60-day deadline, which could result in tax consequences and penalties.

3. Roth conversion: Fidelity also allows you to convert a Traditional IRA or a pre-tax employer-sponsored retirement plan (e.g., 401(k)) into a Roth IRA. This conversion involves paying taxes on the converted amount, but it provides the opportunity for tax-free growth and tax-free qualified withdrawals in the future.

4. Inherited IRA transfers: If you've inherited an IRA from a deceased individual, Fidelity can facilitate the transfer of the inherited IRA into an Inherited IRA account with Fidelity. They provide guidance and support throughout the process to ensure compliance with the specific rules and regulations for inherited IRAs.

It's important to note that rules and regulations regarding transfers and rollovers can change, so it's always recommended to consult with a Fidelity representative or a financial advisor to understand the latest requirements and ensure a smooth transfer process. They can guide you through the necessary steps, provide assistance in completing the paperwork, and answer any questions you may have specific to your situation.
