## Business makes your taxes easier  
  
Businesses have different tax rules than individuals. For example, businesses can deduct certain expenses from their income before paying taxes on the remaining amount. This can help reduce the amount of taxes they owe. Additionally, businesses may be eligible for certain tax credits that can further reduce their tax liability.  
  
  
If you are self-employed or own a business, you are required to file an annual tax return and pay estimated taxes quarterly. You will report your business profits and losses on your personal income tax return (Form 1040) as well as Schedule C.
