## Prep  
*Master algorithms to be able to solve within 5 to 20 minutes  
>[!note] 
>Look on Glassdoor, and then checking Reddit and Quora you can also check their employees on LinkedIn and see if you have any mutual connections you can try to connect to find out about the type of interview question

1. **Focus on One Problem:**  
- Identify problem area.
- Pick one problem something simple like an array question or something.
- Read problems and break them down to understand don't solve practice doing until you feel comfortable then revisit and solveÂ 
  
2. **[[]] Solution:**  
- Come up with a Bruteforce solution to gain insight into the problem's dynamics.  
  
3. **Naive Solution:**  
- Develop a naive solution, distinct from the Bruteforce approach.  
- Space out attempts, allowing time for fresh perspectives.
- The Naive solution can be done Imperatively or Declarative consider doing both ways to see if you can do it.
- Lastly consider runtime complexity and data structures brainstorming thinking about their application in terms of access, searching, insertion, and deletion.  

  
4. **Optimal Solution & Grokking Algorithm Patterns:** 
> ***Consider Pair Programming here or in earlier approach
- Develop a Optimal approach
- Consider experiment with looping iteratively and recursively.  
- Delve into advanced algorithm patterns for solution. 
- Think about what patterns can be used for the problem which can be solved with many different patterns depending on the problem itself.
- Keep in mind that one pattern may be more Optimal then the other.
- Also think about Sorting algorithms, create helper functions for code modularity also naming convention.
