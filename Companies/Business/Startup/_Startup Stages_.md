## Seed Scenario
At the seed stage, a startup has typically completed its initial funding round, raising between €300k and €1.5M. This early financial boost supports the company as it begins selling its product or service and seeks additional talent to facilitate market entry and testing.

[[Pre-Seed Scenario]] 1 to 5 
[[Series A Scenario]] 10 to 50 
[[Series B Scenario]] 50 to 150
[[Series C Scenario]] 150 to 400  
[[Series D Scenario]] 400 to 800 

The workforce size at this juncture varies, but key insights into equity and stock options can guide potential employees:

**Stock Option Plan Issued:**
- **General Allocation:** Seed-stage startups often allocate between 2% and 8% of their fully diluted shares to stock options for employees. This equity is distributed based on factors like expertise, role importance, and company needs.
- **CTO Equity:** A Chief Technology Officer (CTO) might receive between 1% and 4%, reflecting their crucial role in the company's growth and technological development.
- **Employee Equity:** Other employees can expect to negotiate for 0.25% to 2.0% in stock options. This range accounts for variables such as experience, seniority, and the specific skill set brought to the team.

**No Stock Option Plan Issued:**
- In scenarios where the company hasn't issued stock options during the seed round, employees are typically promised options in the subsequent funding round. However, the strike price for these options will likely be set at the future round's share price, meaning any equity gains are realized from the value created after that round. Here, negotiating for a higher equity percentage, ranging from 0.50% to 4.0%, is advisable due to the delayed benefit.

**Maximizing Equity Stake:**
- Individuals aiming for a significant equity stake or a position akin to a co-founder have two primary strategies: investing directly into the business and/or accepting a lower salary than initially anticipated. These sacrifices can substantially increase equity share, potentially exceeding 4% and reaching up to 10%, depending on the investment's size.

**Impactful Results:**
- Using successful companies as benchmarks, a 1% equity stake secured during the seed stage could result in substantial financial outcomes. For example, at the time of their respective exits (IPO or acquisition), such a stake would have been worth approximately $244M in Facebook, $97M in WhatsApp, $4.9M in Instagram, and $830k in Mint.com.

These scenarios highlight the potential financial rewards of joining a startup at the seed stage, especially when securing equity. However, they also underscore the importance of understanding the terms of stock options and the potential benefits of negotiating for a higher equity stake, particularly in cases where options are promised in future funding rounds.


## Questions to Ask

Navigating equity compensation negotiations can seem daunting, but with a straightforward and informed approach, you can effectively determine a fair equity offer. Here’s a simplified strategy to guide you through this process:

1. **Inquire About the Stock Option Plan Size:**
   Start by directly asking the HR manager about the size of the stock option plan that has been allocated for employee equity. This conversation will help you understand whether the equity pool is more conservative (around 3%) or more generous (up to 10%).

2. **Understand Peer Equity Compensation:**
   Next, tactfully inquire about the equity awards given to peers at your level. Approach this conversation with a focus on fairness rather than comparison, to gain insight into the standard equity range within your role. HR’s willingness to disclose this information, coupled with the security provided by the typical one-year cliff in stock options, should facilitate a transparent discussion.

3. **Seek External Insights:**
   Expand your research beyond the company. Engage with friends in other startups, venture capitalists, or online communities like Reddit’s r/Entrepreneurship. This broader perspective can provide a benchmark for equity compensation in similar roles and stages, helping you to adjust your expectations.

4. **Set Your Equity Expectation with a Negotiation Margin:**
   Armed with this information, determine your desired equity stake. Anticipate negotiation and incorporate a margin into your initial ask to ensure you end up with a fair share after the likely bargaining process.

5. **Consider the Company’s Funding Level:**
   A company’s funding status can be a strong indicator of its stability and growth prospects. For instance, a startup that has secured over $2 million in funding, as per Crunchbase, is generally considered to be in a solid position. This insight can inform your total compensation package expectations, balancing salary and equity based on the company's financial health.

6. **Research and Total Compensation Strategy:**
   Finally, research the company’s revenue and funding to understand its valuation and growth trajectory. This will help you craft a well-informed total compensation expectation that aligns with both the company's stage and your contribution's potential value.

By following these steps, you ensure that your approach to negotiating equity is both strategic and informed, positioning you to secure a fair and potentially lucrative compensation package.
