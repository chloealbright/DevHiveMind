"In JavaScript, the behavior of the built in `sort` method may not always align with your expectations. For instance, when sorting letters, it usually works as anticipated. However, when dealing with numbers, a different set of rules comes into play. JavaScript converts numbers to strings during sorting, using the `charCodeAt` method which relies on Unicode values.

Furthermore, it's important to note that the performance of the `sort` method can vary depending on the web browser you're using. This leads to differences in terms of Big O complexity.

When working with built-in sorting methods in various programming languages, it's crucial to understand how they function under the hood. Implementation details can differ, affecting the results you get.

As a side note, while sorting algorithms are important, it's wise not to become overly fixated on them during interviews. Often, it's more crucial to demonstrate your problem-solving skills and understanding of data structures and algorithms as a whole."
