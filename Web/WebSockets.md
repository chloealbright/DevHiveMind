WebSocket is a communication protocol facilitating two-way streaming over a single TCP connection, commonly between web clients and servers but also employed for server-to-server interactions. Major browsers support WebSocket, making it prevalent in real-time applications.

Examples include Slack utilizing WebSockets to relay diverse workspace events, and Trello employing them to transmit server changes to listening browsers. Blockchain leverages its WebSocket API for real-time notifications on transactions and blocks.

WebSockets offer low-overhead full-duplex communication, crucial for real-time interactions, and can function over ports 80 or 443, bypassing firewall restrictions. Enterprise developers, concerned with security, may prefer WebSocket APIs over WebHooks, avoiding the need to expose an HTTP endpoint.

While advantageous for live streaming and prolonged connections, caution is warranted for mobile or unreliable connectivity scenarios. Clients must maintain connections, and scalability issues arise; developers managing multiple connections, as seen with Slack's WebSocket API, face challenges, especially in maintaining numerous connections for widespread app installations.
