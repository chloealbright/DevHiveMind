- [ ] Looking to automating stock buys
- [ ] Look if you can convert Algorithm Patterns solutions into declarative solutions still using the pattern
- [ ] Develop practical fundamental skills around design patterns 
- [ ] Code base decisions made at low level in the design of classes and functions and decisions being made

- [ ] And maybe even a higher level with technologies and stuff
- [ ] Design patterns mindmap
- [ ] look into which info-graphics can be recreated and integrated in to note vault

Build something specific clear goals

Track reference notes in Obsidian Which are notes that are essentially Notes written in someone Else's words to reference 

Create a code base level mind map around decisions being made at the Code base level include things like asynchronized and synchronize code  
  
  
Take in user story convert into high level object oriented class Map breakdown down structure  


When you want to learn new languages in the future think about every time you have to prepare for technical interviews to start interviewing for a new job change what language you practice in once you feel like you have good understanding of how to build up solutions to programming challenges



### Constraints
- [ ] Relax constraints solve problems you want to solve within the problem or alternate problem that is similar or close to the original

### Feature check
- When learning a new feature/technology or library  think about how commonly used and at what stage of the development process or Codebase contribution process will it be used at to decide on the time you give to it in terms of the breath and depth 
	- like if your deciding to go in depth into something you may do it immediately or in the future like with java class loaders or loggers
- or over the long term like learning all the different Java versions in-depth or at least in breath over time in small chunks
