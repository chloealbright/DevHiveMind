Running an application refers to its execution in a production environment, where end-users access and use it.  

This involves activities like setting up and configuring servers, databases, and other infrastructure components to host the application.  

when you select run, it does the [[Language/_Build Tool/Build|Build]] process, but it also executes your project.
