1. **Iterative Debugging:**
   - Repeatedly encounter the same issue? Break down the problem into smaller steps, and systematically eliminate potential sources of error.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - Explore the impact of removing specific lines. How does each change affect the program's behavior? Understand the code's dependencies and interactions.

3. **Strategic Code Removal:**
   - Experiment by selectively removing lines of code to identify the root cause. Document the consequences of each removal to pinpoint problematic sections.

4. **Critical Thinking:**
   - Engage in thoughtful analysis rather than relying on excessive console logging. Challenge yourself to mentally trace the code execution path for a deeper understanding.

5. **Efficient Debugging:**
   - Minimize reliance on console logs, using them only when necessary. Opt for active reasoning and mental simulation to grasp the code's flow and identify potential issues.

6. **Lazy Processing Awareness:**
   - Be mindful of lazy mental processing through excessive console logging. Strive for a more proactive approach by mentally debugging, enhancing overall problem-solving skills.

7. **Problem Isolation:**
   - Isolate the problematic section through a process of elimination. What happens if specific lines are omitted? This focused approach aids in identifying and addressing issues efficiently.

8. **Cognitive Discipline:**
   - Train yourself to resist the urge to overuse console logs. Cultivate disciplined thinking by relying on mental debugging techniques, fostering a deeper understanding of the codebase.

9. **Methodical Approach:**
   - Approach debugging as a methodical investigation. Consider the logical flow and dependencies within the code, gradually uncovering the root cause without resorting to excessive logging.

10. **Reflective Practice:**
    - Regularly reflect on your debugging process. Are there patterns of code removal that consistently reveal issues? Adjust your approach to strike a balance between console logging and mental analysis.
