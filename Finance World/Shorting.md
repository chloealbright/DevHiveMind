*(Margin account required)

basically changing the order you do things buy betting that against a stock by doing the opposite of buying low and selling high, instead your selling a stock high and planing to re-buy it at a lower price your basically using someone else shares  
  
A good example of this is if you have a lot of money shorting can be very helpful like if you have 10,000 shares Bank of America stock then you short it in order to raise the price on the other stock that you own like Ally savings Bank which isn't a brick-and-mortar and has less cost and has a better future growth  
  
Don't do shorts with stocks that give dividends can lead to fees  
  
watch out when alot of people are shorting a stock the borrowing cost can be more then 10%  
  
avoid shorting small companies
