However, here's a general suggested order:\n\n> Closed ended question can be asked after any of these question types\n\n1. **Open Questions:** Start with open-ended questions to gauge the candidate's understanding and approach to the coding challenge.\n\n2. **Recall and Process Questions:** Assess their knowledge recall and understanding of the problem. This helps ensure they grasp the basics before diving deeper.\n\n3. **Divergent Questions:** Encourage open discussion and opinion sharing. This can provide insights into their problem-solving thought process.\n\n4. **Probing Questions:** Use follow-up questions to understand perspectives and encourage deeper reasoning. This helps in evaluating the depth of their understanding and thought process.\n\n5. **Comparison Questions:** Ask higher-order questions to compare different aspects of their solution or approach. This assesses their ability to critically analyze and make informed comparisons.\n\n6. **Evaluation Questions:** Move to questions requiring value judgments or anticipation of future events. This assesses their ability to think critically about the consequences of their choices.\n\n7. **Inference Questions:** Pose questions demanding inductive or deductive reasoning. This helps evaluate their ability to draw logical conclusions from the information provided.\n\n8. **Application Questions:** Assess their ability to apply concepts in a new context, mirroring real-world scenarios.\n\n9. **Affective Questions:** End with questions that seek to understand their emotional responses to the challenge. This can provide insights into their overall engagement and satisfaction.\n\nRemember that the goal is not only to assess technical skills but also problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication skills. Adjust the order based on the nature of the coding challenge and the specific qualities you want to emphasize in your evaluation.","x":-1740,"y":-1160,"width":680,"height":1180},
