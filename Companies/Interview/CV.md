Dear Company Recruitment, 

After researching your company and its commitment to [Company Value or Goal], I am eager to apply for the Full-Stack Engineer position. With a background in developing and maintaining web applications, as well as supporting fellow software engineers in a Business Systems Analyst (BSA) capacity, I am confident in my ability to excel in this role. I am passionate about the process of strategizing, designing, and constructing data models, coupled with mapping out the functionality of an application. This parallels the way an architect builds a structure based on a meticulously crafted blueprint. This is a key factor in why I identify as a software carpenter, who will become a software architect because I follow this mantra “become better than you were yesterday.”  




I have learned many things, like how the development process can be like a relay race where the work that you put into a feature can be a dependency for another teammates work & the overall codebase functionality while working at TracFlo, were I worked  a PERN stack within a Linux environment. Over the course of 16 weeks, I built 13+ features that allowed 50+ general contractors and subcontracting companies to manage projects with up to 35+ active users, each with varying roles and permissions. I also worked on a feature that enabled users to create, edit, and get all equipment and materials within a ticket, which averaged 135+ tickets created per company project. 

so it is important to communicate. In my previous position as a BSA I put these skillsets into practice by were I collaborated with a third-party upskilling firm to develop and implement an internal upskilling program. This involved supporting software engineers in setting up WSL along with Docker and resulted in upskilling over 200+ software engineers across 10 cohorts in a span of 5 months, covering Advanced Java, Spring Boot, Docker, Event-Driven Architecture, and Reactive Programming.















## path 2 
Over the years, I have worked with many technologies and am most familiar with JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap creating self-containing, reusable, and testable components. As for the back-end I have worked with technologies like Express.js, Node, PostgreSQL, and Docker while applying MVC design patterns for separation of concerns and business-logic-containment, increasing back-end performance, development, iteration, and debugging efficiency by 20%. I have also worked with OOP & Data Structures & Algorithms Using Java and JavaScript. I’ve also worked with GitHub, RESTful APIs, and asynchronous programming.


## Conclusion


I am excited about the opportunity to bring my skills and experience to [Company] and contribute to its success. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team in more detail. 

Sincerely, [Your Name] [Your Contact Information]
