1. Invalid Input Test Cases:
    
    - These test cases examine how your code handles invalid or unexpected inputs.
    - They help demonstrate your error-handling skills and your code's ability to gracefully handle exceptions.

2. Performance Test Cases:
    
    - In some interviews, performance might be a critical factor.
    - Performance test cases check how your code behaves under certain constraints (e.g., time or space complexity).
    - Relevant for positions where optimizing algorithms is crucial.

3. Stress Test Cases:
    
    - Stress test cases push your code to its limits by providing large or complex inputs.
    - They assess the scalability and efficiency of your solution.
    - Often relevant for roles involving systems or software that need to handle heavy loads.

4. Randomized Test Cases:
    
    - Randomized test cases involve unpredictable input data.
    - They help evaluate your code's correctness and its ability to handle diverse scenarios.
    - Useful for assessing your problem-solving skills in unfamiliar situations.
    
5. Real-World Test Cases:
    
    - Sometimes, interviewers may present scenarios resembling real-world use cases.
    - These assess your ability to translate practical problems into code.
    - Especially important for roles that require understanding and solving real-world issues.

# Testing Private Methods


  - To test a private method, create an instance of that class and try to print the output of the variable or method that was private.
    - You could try to call the private method in a class that should have access and asserts that the call failed.
