Ensure ongoing alignment between solutions and needs by incorporating regular checks and communication strategies:

1. **Regular Confirmation:**
   - Consistently verify the continued relevance and effectiveness of solutions in relation to identified needs.

2. **Engage with Key Individuals:**
   - Initiate conversations with specific stakeholders to gain insights, feedback, and updates regarding evolving requirements.

3. **Stakeholder Walkthroughs:**
   - Regularly conduct comprehensive walkthroughs of requirements with relevant stakeholders to ensure shared understanding and alignment.

4. **Peer Reviews:**
   - Implement peer reviews of requirements, fostering collaborative evaluation and refinement among team members.

5. **Deep Inspections:**
   - Perform thorough inspections toward project completion, recognizing that these may be less frequent than peer reviews. This step is crucial for capturing new information that emerges throughout the process.
