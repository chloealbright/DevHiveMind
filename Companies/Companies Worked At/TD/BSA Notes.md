Have conversations to gather info from different info sources while also mapping out and planning future conversions in meetings that you will schedule and maybe host you should be aware of the sequence of conversation/meetings and dependencies, also add context make point and create/ask estimation for timelines   




**Ask Questions in this order 

The  

**What**(broadest question of them all) - identify the different scenarios and dependencies  

**Why**- identify the root overall or at specific scopes 

	Can you tell me what's leading you to this request  

	Do you have any perspective on where... And whatever else you're trying to say it's another way of asking why   Is there any reason this wouldn't have...   
	
	Instead of asking why directly which can offend or make people feel type away you can be creative as the top example shows  
	
	Then you can actually ask why for the question you want to ask so you basically kind of want to build up to actually action why while still asking why in the above examples 

**Which** - Identify the specific point or comparing points  
**How** - identify the steps 
**When** - identify the time  
**Where** - identify the location   

Start off with open ended questions then when you want specific information go into closed ended questions which are yes or no or limited choice questions to get decisive responses 

Ask Contextual & non  Contextual questions the elicit more information like you can say so of topic etc...question 

## Privacy  

As a BSA you have private information do not share with other teams certain information because you're formulating the plans and you want to avoid riling up other people in the department so be aware of the culture and people temperament. 

Make  sure you understand the information you're talking about and who you talking to it about especially stakeholders you don't want to potentially give away information that you shouldn't have that can cause problems between people 

So think about how the work or what you're trying to implement may impact them and what you're doing and assess who are supporters and non-supporters when it comes to approaches and decisions  

## Translate business' to technical requirement with context 

### Identify and think about doing 

Organization position

Priority of needs and wants  

Define what applies or doesn’t apply 

Justify why a requirement is needed describing its value, level of complexity, cost, and legal  

  Identify external constraints of geopolitical or regulations or legal   Identify information to keep private and public between internal   Identify BAU    Identify alternative actions, potential risk, and hurdles    Review plan with stakeholders to make sure everything is business aligned  

Identify transition requirements they'll always be some type of transition sometimes and it is basically requirements that apply and when moving from the present to the future state and can be temporary 

### Potential responsibilities: 

Assist testing teams in translating requirements and use cases into test conditions and expected results for product, performance, user acceptance, and operational acceptance testing  Contribute to project management activities such as: scoping and estimating project efforts, identifying risks and recommending mitigation measures, communicating activity status, as well as escalating and communicating possible Issue  Participate in quality management reviews, Including designs, prototypes and other requirements work products   Work with vendors to support business case development (consistent with technology requirements and guidelines) including benefits Identification, RF/RFP and service level agreements

Shadow stakeholders to understand processes


## Needs + Wants + Data = ***Buisness Requirements***


## Needs of Stake Holders (drives user wants)  


Tends to depend on different factors like to scope of the project and its functionality  
 

Business needs can I arise from multiple things like 

Customer complaints 
New market segments and niches 
profit decrease 
process inefficiency 
New competitor on the market 

 

Needs can come from the top from the bottom which can be probably you from middle management who needs more information 
or from external drivers as mentioned above 

 

Identify stockholders incentives, influences, and motivation then categorize & prioritize  
 

When defining this, if the problem is relatively small they may be less needs to define
but if you are in a situation where you are rebuilding functionality like with tracflo or
you creating something from scratch the number of needs and scope can drastically increase  

 

Look into stakeholders more to identify experience some might be very knowledgably 
thus have a good grasp on their needs while others may need your help to establish needs  

 

You should take into account state of industry and available info and see if there are similar solutions to what your creating  

 

Also identify mandatory requirements vs needs 






## Wants of Users 

 

From number and diversity of stakeholders  

Take into account 

Scope 

Organizational culture  

 

Before establishing wants you need to identify the established information and its level of detail   




## Data 

 
Data Relevance 

Data  Quality 

Data Volume   

Data availability 

Data accessibility(like format) 

 

Data can be db data or documentation   

 

How long of a time period do we have the data like when dealing with sensitive data that you have abide by regulation  

 

How applicable is this data what info is shown 




##  Assumptions

**Factors that are considered to be true, but have not yet been proven.
 
### BSAs should do 3 things with assumptions

Identify and document:
Attempts to confirm their accuracy
Manage requirement related risks or risk with how well the solution can meet business needs

Constraints:
Impositions or restrictions on a project that can limit the choices a project can make. Typical categories include business, technical, and external. They always limit a solution, whether it is scope, time  or cost.
 
Triple constrain: Budget, time, scope
