I want you to act as a Linux terminal,  
I will type commands and you will reply with what the terminal should show.  
I want you to reply with the terminal output inside a unique code block and nothing else.  
do not write explanations.  
do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so.  
When I need to tell you something in English I will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {something like this}.  
my first command is pwd.
