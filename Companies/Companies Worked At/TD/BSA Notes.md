### **Conducting Effective Conversations for Requirements Gathering:**

As a Business Systems Analyst (BSA), engaging in purposeful conversations is critical. Ensure a structured approach by adhering to the following sequence:

1. **Ask Questions in this Order:**
   - **What(broadest question of them all):** Identify different scenarios and dependencies.
   - **Why:** Uncover the root causes at various scopes, using creative and indirect queries.
	   - Other way of asking why  
		   - Can you tell me what's leading you to this request  
		   - Do you have any perspective on where... 
		   - Is there any reason this wouldn't have...   
	   - Instead of asking why directly which can offend or make people feel type away you can be creative as the top example shows  
	   - Then you can actually ask why for the question you want to ask so you basically kind of want to build up to the why while still asking why in the above examples 
   - **Which:** Pinpoint specific points or compare options.
   - **How:** Identify the necessary steps.
   - **When:** Determine the timeline.
   - **Where:** Identify the location.

   Start with open-ended questions, transitioning to closed-ended ones for specific information and decisive responses.
   
   Pose both contextual and non-contextual questions to extract additional information. For instance, you can introduce queries with phrases like "so, off-topic," allowing for a broader exploration of relevant details.
   
1. **Privacy Considerations:**
   - Safeguard private information, especially when formulating plans.
   - Be aware of the organizational culture and people's temperament.
   - Assess how the work may impact stakeholders, identifying supporters and non-supporters.

### **Translating Business Needs to Technical Requirements:**

#### **Identify and Consider:**
   - Organization position and its impact on structure.
   - Priority of needs and wants.
   - Applicability of requirements, justifying their value, complexity, cost, and legal aspects.
   - External constraints, geopolitical factors, regulations, and legal considerations.
   - Business as usual (BAU) operations.
   - Alternative actions, potential risks, and hurdles.

#### **Potential Responsibilities:**
   - Assist testing teams in translating requirements into test conditions.
   - Contribute to project management activities, scoping, estimating, and risk identification.
   - Participate in quality management reviews, collaborating with vendors on business case development.

#### **Certifications for BSA:**
   - PMI, PBA, CBAP.

### **Functional and Non-Functional Requirements:**
   - Functional requirements describe how the system must work.
   - Non-functional requirements specify how the system should perform.

### **Key Responsibilities of a BSA:**
   - User support, case resolution, system enhancement identification.
   - Leverage Salesforce.com for evolving business requirements.
   - Develop project deliverables, solution design, and system configuration.
   - Collaborate with teams for issue resolution, upgrades, and releases.
   - Shadow stakeholders to understand processes.

### **Understanding Stakeholder Needs:**
**Needs of Stake Holders drives user wants
>[!note]
> Determine stakeholders' incentives, influences, and motivations, and subsequently, categorize and prioritize them. When assessing these factors, consider that smaller issues may require fewer needs to define. Conversely, in scenarios involving the rebuilding of functionality, as seen with Tracflo, or the creation of something entirely new, the number of needs and scope may significantly expand.
#### **Needs + Wants + Data = Business Requirements:**
   - Business needs arise from factors like customer complaints, market changes, and process inefficiencies.
   - Stakeholder incentives, influences, and motivations should be identified, categorized, and prioritized.
   - Consider the scope, organizational culture, and established information when determining user wants.
   - Assess data relevance, quality, volume, availability, and accessibility.

### Data Considerations

- **Data Relevance:** Assess the pertinence of the data to the project objectives.
- **Data Quality:** Evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the available data.
- **Data Volume:** Determine the quantity of data required for the project.
- **Data Availability:** Ensure that necessary data is accessible when needed.
- **Data Accessibility (Format):** Consider the format in which the data is stored or presented.

**Additional Considerations:**
- **Data Types:** Distinguish between database (db) data and documentation.
- **Time Period:** Clarify the timeframe for data availability, especially with sensitive information subject to regulatory compliance.
- **Applicability:** Evaluate the relevance of the data and the specific information it contains.

### **Assumptions and Constraints:**
   - **Assumptions:** Identify, document, confirm accuracy, and manage risks associated with unproven factors.
   - **Constraints:** Recognize impositions or restrictions on the project, including business, technical, and external constraints.
   - **Triple Constraint:** Consider the interplay of budget, time, and scope in project management.
