candle sticks patterns that let you know if it might be a good time to enter a stock  
-------------------------------------------  
The bullish engulfing pattern is formed of two candlesticks. The first candle is a short red body that is completely engulfed by a larger green candle.  
Though the second day opens lower than the first, the bullish market pushes the price up, culminating in an obvious win for buyers.  
  
  
The hammer candlestick pattern is formed of a short body with a long lower wick, and is found at the bottom of a downward trend.  
A hammer shows that although there were selling pressures during the day, ultimately a strong buying pressure drove the price back up. The colour of the body can vary, but green hammers indicate a stronger bull market than red hammers.  
  
The morning star candlestick pattern is considered a sign of hope in a bleak market downtrend. It is a three-stick pattern: one short-bodied candle between a long red and a long green. Traditionally, the ‘star’ will have no overlap with the longer bodies, as the market gaps both on open and close.  
It signals that the selling pressure of the first day is subsiding, and a bull market is on the horizon.  
  
When a market’s open and close are almost at the same price point, the candlestick resembles a cross or plus sign – traders should look out for a short to non-existent body, with wicks of varying length.  
This doji’s pattern conveys a struggle between buyers and sellers that results in no net gain for either side. Alone a doji is neutral signal, but it can be found in reversal patterns such as the bullish morning star and bearish evening star.  
  
The spinning top candlestick pattern has a short body centred between wicks of equal length. The pattern indicates indecision in the market, resulting in no meaningful change in price: the bulls sent the price higher, while the bears pushed it low again. Spinning tops are often interpreted as a period of consolidation, or rest, following a significant uptrend or downtrend.  
On its own the spinning top is a relatively benign signal, but they can be interpreted as a sign of things to come as it signifies that the current market pressure is losing control.  
  
The Tweezer Top formation is viewed as a bearish reversal pattern seen at the top of uptrends and the Tweezer Bottom formation is viewed as a bullish reversal pattern seen at the bottom of downtrends.
