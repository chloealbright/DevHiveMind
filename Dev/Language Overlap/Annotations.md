In Java, annotations are a form of metadata that can be added to Java code elements, such as classes, methods, variables, and parameters. Annotations provide additional information about the code elements they are associated with. They are denoted by the "@" symbol followed by the annotation name.  
  
Annotations serve several purposes in Java, including:  
  
1. Code Documentation: Annotations can be used to add descriptive information to code, making it easier to understand and maintain. They can provide documentation about the purpose, usage, or constraints of a code element.  
  
2. Compiler Instructions: Annotations can be used to provide instructions to the Java compiler or other tools. For example, the `@Override` annotation indicates that a method is intended to override a superclass method. If the method doesn't actually override a superclass method, the compiler will generate an error.  
  
3. Runtime Processing: Annotations can be processed at runtime using Java reflection. This allows programs to examine and modify annotated code elements dynamically. Frameworks and libraries often use annotations to configure and customize behavior.  
  
4. Code Generation: Annotations can be used to generate code automatically. By analyzing annotations, tools can generate additional code or configuration files based on the specified criteria. This can help reduce boilerplate code and improve productivity.  
  
Java provides several built-in annotations, such as `@Override`, `@Deprecated`, and `@SuppressWarnings`, which have specific meanings and effects on the code. Additionally, developers can define their own annotations by using the `@interface` keyword.  
  
Annotations are a powerful feature of Java that enable developers to add metadata and behavior to their code, making it more expressive and adaptable to different scenarios.
