Enhance the software development lifecycle by eliminating obstacles across ideation, implementation, testing, building, deployment, and system observation. This is achieved through the automation and streamlining of processes, optimizing the overall system.

Collaboration between developers and operations managers is pivotal in bridging gaps. Traditionally, developers focus on creating new features, while operations maintain the existing system. DevOps implementation can differ among companies, encompassing continuous integration and delivery, source code and package management, infrastructure treated as code, container orchestration, cloud utilization, and continuous monitoring.

In essence, DevOps aims to harmonize and enhance the entire software development and deployment lifecycle through collaborative efforts and the adoption of streamlined, automated practices.
