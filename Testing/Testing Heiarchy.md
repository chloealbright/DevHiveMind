# Testing ordered by time it takes 

Unit tests -> integration testing -> End to End test  

## Unit Testing

Mocha testing good in between similar to jest and works with chai test suite 

Unit testing: Validating that each software unit performs as expected. A unit is the smallest testable component of an application.



## Integration Testing
Integration testing (sometimes called integration and testing, abbreviated I&T) is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. Integration testing is conducted to evaluate the compliance of a system or component with specified functional requirements. 

integration testing or testing  is used to test out the different flows of the code and if they react as expected if not they can be a issue in the test or logic

## End to End/UI Testing
End to end testing takes the longest and is also known as end-to-end testing because it's testing core functionality.   


Spend 10% of your time working on you End to end test 

20% integration test 

70% on unit test since it takes less time to make a whole bunch  

Doing this helps you have good test coverage across individual classes via unit testing 

prioritize integration and End to end test on key user journey/story   


There are two types of testing manual and automated testing
