In software development, a thread's lifetime refers to the duration it exists and is active within a program. Threads are independent units of execution that operate concurrently. Throughout their lifetime, threads can transition through different states, representing their current status and activity. The typical thread states in a multithreading environment are:

1. **New:**
   - A thread is in the "New" state when it's created but not yet started. At this stage, the necessary system resources are allocated, but the thread has not begun execution.

2. **Runnable/Ready:**
   - The "Runnable" or "Ready" state signifies that the thread has been started and is eligible to run. However, it may be waiting for its turn to be executed by the CPU.

3. **Blocked:**
   - A thread enters the "Blocked" state when it is temporarily inactive. This can happen for various reasons, such as waiting for a resource, I/O operations, or synchronization issues. The thread is still alive but cannot progress until the condition causing the block is resolved.

4. **Waiting:**
   - Threads may enter the "Waiting" state when explicitly waiting for another thread to perform a specific action, often signaled by a notification or timeout. They remain inactive until the condition they are waiting for is met.

5. **Timed Waiting:**
   - Similar to the "Waiting" state, threads in "Timed Waiting" are waiting for a specific condition but for a limited time. If the condition is not met within the specified time, the thread transitions to the "Runnable" state.

6. **Terminated/Dead:**
   - A thread reaches the "Terminated" or "Dead" state when it has completed its execution or explicitly terminated. In this state, the thread's resources are released, and it no longer participates in the program's execution.

Understanding these thread states is crucial for effective multithreading, as it helps developers manage the flow of execution, handle synchronization, and optimize resource utilization in concurrent applications.
