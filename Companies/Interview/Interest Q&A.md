Why did you move to Amsterdam? What made you move away from HQ? (Both my future manager and the most senior engineer moved)  
  
Why do you think Uber moved something so key like Payments to a small site? I was very skeptical of any sensible company moving strategic work away from the HQ, so I circled around this question throughout my "reverse interviews".  
  
What are the last three projects you've shipped? Then I asked more about one that sounded the most interesting, to get a sense of the work - this was especially helpful when talking with the engineer.  
  
What is the project you're most proud of working on at Uber? Why?  
  
What is the biggest struggle you have/had at Uber? Why?  
  
What are you most excited about for the next six months?  
  
What did your typical workweek look like the past month?  
  
Tell me about the team. How would you describe the team dynamics? Again, I got very good - and blunt - feedback from the senior engineer.  
  
Assuming I joined, what advice would you give to be successful?  
  
What are things that you have seen new joiners struggle with?  
  
Has anyone left the team? If so, what was the reason?
