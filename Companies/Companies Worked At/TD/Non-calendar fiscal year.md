A non-calendar fiscal year is basically when you go against the standard fiscal year start and end, which runs from January 1st to December 31st. Instead, a company like for example TD Bank may choose to use a fiscal year that aligns with its business cycle or strategic planning needs. The fiscal year is a 12-month period used by organizations for financial reporting and budgeting.  
  
Banks and other businesses may opt for a non-calendar fiscal year for various reasons:  
  
1. **Business Cycle Alignment:** Some banks may choose a fiscal year that aligns with their business cycle or industry trends. For example, if a bank's peak business activity occurs in a particular quarter that does not coincide with the calendar year, it might choose a fiscal year that better reflects its performance.  
  
2. **Regulatory Compliance:** Regulatory requirements or accounting standards in a particular jurisdiction may influence the choice of a fiscal year. Some jurisdictions may allow flexibility in selecting fiscal year-end dates, and banks may choose a non-calendar fiscal year that complies with local regulations.  
  
3. **Internal Planning and Reporting:** Banks often use their fiscal year to align with internal planning and reporting cycles. For example, strategic planning, budgeting, and performance assessments may be more closely tied to the bank's specific fiscal year rather than the calendar year.  
  
4. **Industry Norms:** In some cases, industry norms or practices may influence a bank's decision to adopt a non-calendar fiscal year. If many banks in a particular region or sector use a similar fiscal year, it may make coordination and comparison more straightforward.  
  
It's important to note that while many banks and businesses use a fiscal year that aligns with the calendar year, others may choose a different fiscal year-end date based on their specific needs and circumstances. The choice of a fiscal year is typically disclosed in a bank's financial statements and reports.
