Speaking, Conversation, & Mental Dialogue  
================================  
  
The reason we hate public speaking is because of Epigenetics we associate public speaking with the feeling of having to defend our self's in front of people like when you are being accused of something like being called a witch in the Salem trials or a murder in court  
  
Improving conversation Skills Get in to conversation with out asking yes or no question  
  
Talk to people with the motive of using them.  
  
Speaking is like driving in traffic sometimes you get into a wreck getting in an argument or you cut off someone by accident so slow down and process the information
