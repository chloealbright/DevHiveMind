A specific type of [[Hashtable]] that typically uses chaining to handle [[Hash Collision]].  
Each index in the underlying array typically contains a linked list of key-value pairs, and new pairs are added to the appropriate list when collisions occur. 

HashMap in java is a class which models a map data structure using hash-based implementation, that's why it's called HashMap.
