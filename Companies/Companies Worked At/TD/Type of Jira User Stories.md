In Jira, user stories are a common way of expressing product features or functionalities from an end user's perspective. They help agile teams prioritize and deliver value incrementally. In Jira, user stories are typically created and managed within the context of an Agile board, which is associated with a specific project. Here are some common types of user stories in Jira:

1. **Standard User Stories:**
   - These are the typical user stories representing a single piece of functionality or a feature from the user's perspective.
   - Example: "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [benefit]."

2. **Epic:**
   - An epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into smaller user stories.
   - It represents a broader feature or a set of related features.
   - Epics are often used for high-level planning and breaking down large tasks into more manageable pieces.

3. **Sub-Task:**
   - Sub-tasks are used to break down user stories into smaller, more detailed tasks.
   - They represent the individual steps or components required to complete a user story.
   - Sub-tasks are managed within the context of a parent user story.

4. **BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) User Stories:**
   - These user stories are often written using a Given-When-Then format to describe the behavior of the system.
   - Example: "Given [some initial context], When [an action is performed], Then [the expected outcome should be]."
   - Tools like Cucumber or Behave may be integrated for BDD scenarios.

5. **Non-functional Requirements/User Stories:**
   - These user stories focus on non-functional aspects such as performance, security, or usability.
   - Example: "As a user, I want the application to load within 2 seconds for a better user experience."

6. **Spike(Proof of Concept):**
   - A spike is a user story that is created to explore and gather more information about a certain aspect of the project.
   - It's often used when there is uncertainty or a need for research before estimating and committing to the work.

>Clone and close stories if work continues into next sprint and just in general just quicker to create new stories; if no work has been done, move them forward to next sprint.

In Jira, these user story types are managed and visualized on Agile boards, where teams can plan, track progress, and collaborate on delivering value in an iterative and incremental manner. The specific types and terminology may vary based on the customization and configuration of your Jira instance and the agile methodology your team follows.
