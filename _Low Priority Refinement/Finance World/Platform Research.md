## Yahoo finance breakdown
- Summary tab  
- Statistics tab  
- Historical data tab  
- Profile tab  
- Financial tab  
	- Financial statements, basic info on the company, what analyst think about the company – and even insider trading which could show you some patterns  
	- But the point is, you want to learn all the information you can about the company.  
	- Income statement shows you the total revenue, COGS, and also the expenses of the company  
	- You can see quarterly income statement or annual ones, usually, you want to see quarterly income statements  
	- That you can figure out patterns and if the company is seasonal or not.  
	- Tip: you’re going to have to learn a few terms GAAP, Non-GAAP, and also EBITDA (a good way to figure out company actual earning before all the noncash deductions)  
- Balance Sheet ( is pretty simply)  
	- is basically where you find out what a company owns  
	- also what it owes  
	- and also its shareholder equity ( the amount of money we as investor gave them, but it also includes a few other items )  
	- The Basic Idea:  
		- you’re going to see the companies long term and short assets ( things that can be turned into cash quickly )  
		- Long term and short term debt  
		- And also even how much cash the company has on hand currently  
- Cash flow statement  
	- Is a combination of the income statement and balance sheet  
	- And it's going to paint you an accurate picture of how much money the company actually has in cash  
	- Because income is not cash ( if you haven’t really received it )  
	- So the idea is:  
		-  by doing the cash flow statement  
		- You’re going to see the cash flow from operating the business, from investing and also from finance  
		- Its sounds complicated but it'll connect with the income statement and balance sheet  
- Target price: by creating a financial model based on the financial statements  
	- and that’s the price you set based on the companies projected EARNINGS  
	- But again Overall:  
		- all this is just basic information you need to learn about to understand how to analyze a company.  
		- The resources for research, accounting to look at the current health of the company, and target price to set your own price based on research and invest in the company.  
- Analyst tab  
- Options tab  
- Holders tab  
- SEC website: 10k form, 10q form and s-1 form  
	- And the SEC basically help regulate the stock market to avoid fraud and so on  
	- For example, here are 3 core documents you need to know about  
		- S-1 Form: when a company plans on going public they have to file this document  
		- Tell you about the competition, the risk to the business, potential legal issues (it's one of the most important documents )  
		- 10-k form: And it's basically a simple but long summary of a company financial performance and they have to file it every year. ( this will tell you almost everything about the companies performance.)  
		- even how much they pay management  
		- 10-Q form: this document Is filed every quarter and tell you if a company has been buying other companies  
- As a company grows, its growth slows down, so something to artificially make the company look like its growing, it basically buys other companies.  

- Investor relations: earnings reports, annual reports  
	- It’s another resource that companies provide on their website  
	- That way you can easily navigate it and get all the information you need  
	- From the financial report, to meet, and even live videos  
	- Every website will be different, some will be modern and others will be older ( but focus on the numbers and not how pretty things look)
