============== Level 1 =============== 

These topics are not going to have much ‘testing’ at the beginning. 

Doing 1 or 2 of these questions at the start of your research can help guide you as to where the shortfalls are and direct your study efforts, but apart from that, there’s not much use in grinding through a question you know nothing about. 

Study of level 1 topics will primarily include curating a list of areas that are troublesome and then researching/studying those areas. 

Depending on the topic, you might spend a whole week just doing research before even tackling a question (especially if it’s a big topic). 

For hard topics, attempt 1 question at the very end of the week (after a week of focused research) to give yourself a new baseline. The point here is not to get the question right, but to put what you’ve studied back into context and give yourself the opportunity to study the solutions. Give the question a red hot crack even if you don’t know where to start — get something out. Then, spend a good chunk of time studying the solution — this is how you learn how to do problems! (as opposed to just reading up on the theory). Then add this question to your ‘wrong’ pile and you will retest it again at a later date. 

============== Level 2 =============== 

These topics will have an even balance between research and testing. 

Maintain a good flow with these topics: identify problem area, research, test, study solution, evaluate, retest. 

An emphasis on doing questions is important for level 2 topics. 

Really challenge yourself to just ‘do’. This is how these topics will get to level 3! 

============== Level 3 =============== 

For something to be rated a level 3 means you know “almost everything” about it and shouldn’t really need to do much research at all. 

At this stage, it’s just practice: Test, solutions, test, solutions… 

(and of course retest the questions you’ve gotten wrong!). 

Changing Levels: 

Don’t be too harsh on yourself — if you feel like you’ve made improvement on a topic, MOVE YOURSELF UP! 

However, after studying in this way, you might realize that you need to move something down a level — don’t be alarmed by this. This is part of the process of uncovering problem areas. You’re probably used to assessing your competence on something by ‘vibe’ — now we have an objective measure, so it’s to be expected we might have gotten something wrong. 

For level 2 topics, if you’re spending more time researching than doing questions, then this is an indication that this topic should perhaps move down to a level 1. 

For level 3 questions, if you find that you’re getting them right however it’s consistently poor time and space complexity and your solutions feel a little ‘hacky’, then perhaps it’s a good idea to move this one down to a level 2 and study some more optimal solutions for these types of problems. 

Trust your judgement here and don’t overthink it!
