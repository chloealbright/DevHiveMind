API versioning is a strategic approach in software development for managing different iterations of an API.  
  
It enables developers to deploy new features, fix bugs and enhance performance without destabilizing the current versions used by users.  
  
There are several strategies for API versioning. Some of the most commonly used are URI versioning, header versioning, and query parameter versioning.  
  
Let's look at URI versioning.  
  
This method involves embedding the version number of the API directly in the endpoint URI, allowing distinct paths for different versions.  
  
For instance, an API endpoint could be /api/v1/articles and the next version might be /api/v2/articles.  
  
This method is straightforward and easily understandable, making it popular among developers.

𝗧𝗶𝗽𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗔𝗣𝗜 𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴:  
  
🔸 𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗹𝘆 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴: Establish a straightforward versioning structure from the beginning. For URI versioning, using simple increments like v1, v2, and so on is effective and commonly accepted.  
  
🔸𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵𝗹𝘆: Provide comprehensive documentation for each API version update, detailing changes, additions, and deprecations. Clear documentation is crucial for enabling API consumers to seamlessly adapt their applications.  
  
🔸 𝗨𝘁𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴: Though URI versioning typically indicates major version changes, integrating semantic versioning principles—MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH—into your documentation and release notes can offer additional clarity and detail.  
  
🔸 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: Aim for backward compatibility with new releases. Should breaking changes be required, reserve them for a major version release to minimize user impact.  
  
🔸 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗱𝗲𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗹𝘆: Notify users in advance of impending deprecations, offering clear timelines and assistance for migration to newer versions.  
  
🔸 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗿𝗼𝗯𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: before launching a new version implement robust testing to ensure existing applications continue to operate without interruption.
