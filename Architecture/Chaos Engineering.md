- What is Chaos Engineering? 
    
    -   Chaos Engineering is a disciplined approach to identifying failures before they become outages. “Break things on purpose” to build more resilient systems. 
        
-   What are the benefits of Chaos Engineering? Benefits fall into 3 categories: 
    
    -   Customer benefits  
        
        -   Increased availability and durability of service 
            
    -   Business benefits  
        
        -   Prevent extremely large losses in revenue and maintenance 
            
        -   Happier and Engaged Engineers 
            
    -   Technical benefits  
        
        -   Reduction in incidents 
            
        -   Improved system design 
            
        -   Faster Mean Time To Detection (MTTD) 
            
        -   Increase understanding of system failure modes
