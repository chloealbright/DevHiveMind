Solve the right problems and pay attention to the scope of the problems and how they affect the greater scope of the world or your world  
  
using precision when it comes to scope is good to learn about specific things but again when it comes to precision you are focus on a specific scope of element of that scope  
  
but when you blunt you are less precise but can experience things and get a general feel  
  
this why you cant use one tool for everything you need to learn how use and alternate between being blunt and precise in your approach
