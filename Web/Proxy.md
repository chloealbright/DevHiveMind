In computer networking, a proxy server is a server application that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource and the server providing that resource.  

## 1\. Proxies

Proxies are intermediary servers that stand between clients and other servers. They play a critical role in enhancing performance, security, and reliability in various network scenarios.

## 1.1 Forward Proxy

A forward proxy is a server that acts on behalf of clients to make requests to other servers. Forward proxies can be used for various purposes, such as providing anonymity, enforcing security policies, and caching content.

## 1.2 Reverse Proxy

A reverse proxy is a server that handles client requests on behalf of other servers. Reverse proxies can provide load balancing, SSL termination, and content caching, among other benefits.

Forward Proxy vs Reverse Proxy




## Proxy server vs VPN 

Proxy and VPN defined. A VPN secures all your network traffic, while a proxy works on an application level. They both hide your IP address, but only a VPN redirects your internet data through an encrypted tunnel. A proxy is suitable for browsing the internet, but it's not as safe and secure as a VPN.
