## **[[Tech Glossary#^acb92b| Typed Languages]]:**

### **Statically Typed Languages:**

Statically typed languages require the explicit definition of variable types, offering certain advantages:

- Type must be specified for variables.
- Variables can reference only specific types.
- Type checking is performed at compile time.
- Memory is allocated at compile time.
  
Examples include C, C#, C++, Java, Go, and TypeScript.

### **Dynamically Typed Languages:**

Dynamically typed languages allow more flexibility in variable types:

- No need to specify variable types.
- Variables can reference different types at runtime.
- Type checking occurs during execution.

Examples include Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and Bash.

## **Performance Differences:**

Statically typed languages offer better runtime performance due to the absence of runtime type checking. Dynamically typed languages excel during development and provide greater flexibility.

## **Programming Language Categories:**

### **Low-Level Programming Languages:**

Low-level languages are closely tied to hardware, granting direct access to system resources. They are commonly used for tasks like device drivers and operating systems.

### **Medium-Level Programming Languages:**

Medium-level languages strike a balance between low-level control and high-level abstraction. They are ideal for system-level programming and scientific computing.

### **High-Level Programming Languages:**

High-level languages provide a high level of abstraction, making them user-friendly for application development, web development, and data analysis.

Note: These categories aren't always distinct, and some languages may fit into multiple categories.

## **Other Categories of Languages:**

Explore various programming language categories, including:

1. **Procedural Programming Languages:** Utilizing languages like Assembly and often of an older nature.
2. **Object-Oriented Programming Languages**
3. **Functional Programming Languages**
4. **Scripting Programming Languages**
5. **Markup Languages**
6. **Query Languages**
7. **Logic Programming Languages**
8. **Concurrent Programming Languages**
9. **Compiled Programming Languages**
10. **Interpreted Programming Languages**
11. **Event-Driven Programming Languages**
12. **Domain-Specific Programming Languages**
13. **Declarative Programming Languages**
