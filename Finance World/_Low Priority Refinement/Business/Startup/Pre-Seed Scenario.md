By Pre-Seed, I mean the company does not have revenues nor has ever fundraised. But the founders have their idea, have worked on an MVP for a few months, and havenâ€™t paid themselves since quitting their previous jobs.Â 

Letâ€™s say this stage is your best shot at getting a size able chunk of the equity (also highest risk/reward).Â 

The founding team is typically looking for its third or fourth employee at that point. Itâ€™s looking to beef up a department in which it lacks the right skillset (for ex. two engineers hiring a finance person, or two MBAs hiring a lead dev).Â 

If the company isnâ€™t incorporated: Youâ€™re in luck, this is probably the only case where you will get shares rather than stock options. The cost of issuing and attributing these shares is almost irrelevant for the founders since it will be done concomitantly with the companyâ€™s incorporation. You can also argue to be named co-founder as your name will be on the initial registry of shareholders (I will leave that to your negotiation skillsÂ ðŸ˜‰). Regardless, in this case, you could expect anywhere from 5% to 30% of the companyâ€™s shares.Â 

If the company is already incorporated: it probably means itâ€™s a bit more advanced than the case above. You will be promised stock options at hire. These options will be issued and attributed during the seed fundraising expected to happen 2 to 6 months after your arrival. As a result, the strike price of the options will be at a higher value point than when you joined. The longer after you join does the fundraising occur, the higher you should negotiate in terms of equity compensation. Overall, you should expect anywhere from 5% to 15% of the company.Â 

In both cases, I would argue that devs have more power when it comes to negotiating these days. They have become a scarcity (or maybe theyâ€™ve become just too expensive for startupsÂ ðŸ˜œ).Â 

Finally, as a rule of thumb, these are general assumptions. The equity stake should be adjusted for experience, seniority, needs of the company, and finally skillset. Every situation is different and I have seen people join a pre-seed startup for 1% of the capital (poor negotiation skills or low understanding of how equity works) and others basically become co-founders to receive up to 50% of shares (pro-negotiators or maybe the company was still in relative infancy).Â 

Results: Assuming a 10% stake and several further fundraising rounds, had you joined Facebook at that stage, you would own ~$1.8B at IPO. Had you joined Whatsapp at that stage, at its sale to Facebook, you would own ~$730M. Had you joined Instagram at that stage, at it sale to Facebook, you would own ~$37M. Had you joined Mint.com at that stage, at it sale to Intuit, you would own ~$6M.
