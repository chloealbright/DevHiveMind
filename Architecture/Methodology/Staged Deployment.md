Staged deployment, also known as phased deployment or environment progression, is an approach where the codebase is deployed in multiple stages or environments sequentially before reaching the production environment. Each stage represents a distinct environment with a specific purpose and level of validation. Staged deployment allows for thorough testing, validation, and gradual roll-out of code changes. Here are the typical stages involved in a staged deployment:

1. Development Environment: The development environment is where developers write and test their code. It is a local or dedicated environment where they can experiment, debug, and validate their changes before committing them to version control.

2. Testing Environment: Once the code changes are ready for broader testing, they are deployed to a dedicated testing environment. This environment closely resembles the production environment and allows testers to verify the functionality, performance, and stability of the application.

3. Quality Assurance (QA) Environment: The QA environment is specifically designed for the quality assurance team to perform extensive testing, including user acceptance testing (UAT), performance testing, and load testing. It helps ensure that the application meets the required quality standards before being deployed to production.

4. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Environment: This environment is primarily used for automated build, integration, and deployment processes. It involves the use of continuous integration and continuous deployment tools that automatically build, test, and deploy the application as changes are made to the codebase.

5. Disaster Recovery (DR) Environment: The DR environment serves as a backup or failover environment in case of a disaster or service interruption in the production environment. It replicates the production environment's infrastructure, data, and configurations to ensure business continuity and minimize downtime.

6. Cloud Environment: Cloud environments, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP), offer infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) or platform-as-a-service (PaaS) capabilities. These environments provide scalable, on-demand resources for deploying and managing applications in a cloud-based infrastructure.

7. On-Premises Environment: In contrast to cloud environments, on-premises environments involve deploying and managing applications on local infrastructure within an organization's data center. This environment provides direct control over hardware, network, and security but requires maintenance and scalability considerations.

8. Staging Environment: The staging environment, also known as the pre-production environment or [[_Type of Testing#UAT Testing | UAT]] (User Acceptance Testing) environment, serves as a final checkpoint before deploying to production. It closely mirrors the production environment in terms of infrastructure, configuration, and data. It allows for end-to-end testing, user acceptance testing, and performance testing with realistic data and conditions.

9. Production Environment: After successful testing and validation in the previous stages, the code changes are finally deployed to the production environment. This is the live environment where the application is accessed by end-users or customers. The deployment to the production environment is typically done with caution, following deployment procedures, rollback plans, and monitoring systems to ensure a smooth transition.

### Staged deployment offers several benefits:

- Controlled Validation: Each stage provides an opportunity to validate the code changes and identify any issues or bugs before reaching the production environment. This reduces the risk of deploying faulty code.

- Risk Mitigation: By gradually rolling out the changes, staged deployment allows for identifying and addressing issues early in the deployment pipeline. If issues are detected, the impact can be limited to a smaller user base or specific environments, minimizing the impact on the entire user population.

- Separation of Concerns: Each environment serves a specific purpose, such as development, testing, or production. This separation allows teams to focus on their respective tasks, such as developers writing code, testers validating functionality, and operations teams ensuring production readiness.

- Scalability and Performance Testing: Staged deployment facilitates load testing and performance evaluation in dedicated environments, helping identify bottlenecks, optimize resources, and ensure the application can handle real-world traffic and usage patterns.

It's important to note that the specific stages and environments involved in a staged deployment may vary depending on the project's requirements and organization's practices. The key aspect is to progress through the environments in a controlled manner, ensuring that the code changes are thoroughly tested and validated before reaching the production environment.
