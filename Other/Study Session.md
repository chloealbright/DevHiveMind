## Dedicate 2 Hour Per Study Session

Space out Session Can Be an hour & Maybe 4 Hour Between First & Second Session


You can expand short term memory with practice and repetition 

Specifically purposeful practice focusing on one aspect of a sub skill 


Try differently not harder 

Try alternating approaches 



Become interested in what you're learning 

Chew Gum for around 30 minutes. But if you have a pop quiz sprung on you, leave the Juicy Fruit in your pocket. People who didn’t chew gum did better on very short memory tasks while masticating helped people stay alert during longer ones.  

When you really need to remember something, concentrate on it for at least 8 seconds. Studies have shown that 8 seconds is the minimum amount of time it takes for a piece of information to go from your short-term memory to your long-term memory.  

Know When to Turn the Music On—and Off. start off listening to music to get you into the mood but turn off-after a while to avoid distraction. 

## Exercise 

Get adequate sleep to consolidate and retain memories 

Rub hands or heat up hands in warm water for hand fatigue and soreness, use Coldwater for Studying and memory retention   

Doodle or do something during class to keep your brain active during class otherwise you end up tuning out things 

Make a Fist Studies show that if you are right-handed, you should make a fist with your right hand before you try to memorize a piece of information. Then when you need to remember it, clench your left hand (the process is reversed for lefties.) Be sure to hold that position for a little while though; the study that discovered this had the participants squeezing for a good 45 seconds before letting go.  

Find a way to leverage your visual memory Associate what you're trying to learn with what you already know and try creating a mental memory tree. 

## Memory tip 

To remember things try making acronyms or word associations with what you're trying to remember which is called a mind Palace or make a sentence 

when reading a lot of numbers convert them into numbers meaning associate the number with the letter it looks most like form a word and associate it with something and visualize it with something nasty or traumatic also map your route associating these things with places in your route  

Visualize things by associating things with visual imagery that you can constantly build upon. for example, let’s say you wanted to remember that J.K. Rowling wrote the Harry Potter books. Rowling sounds like bowling, so visualize a bowling alley. Now add to this image a harry potter. This hirsute man, his hands covered with clay, gets up to roll the ball down the lane. From there you could add other bits of information, for example, the names of the different Harry Potter books. 

Do most of your studying in the afternoon Don’t Walk Through a Doorway. something about entering a new place seems to restart our memory.  

## Reading text book  

look through pg and look at images, graphs, number of pg. then look at the end of the chapter for a quiz and try to find the answers later. then go to the beginning of the chapter and read bold print read first and the last sentence of the paragraph for exposure no comprehension. then read the chapter for comprehension 

Use Crazy Fonts We’re all font snobs to some extent. When it comes to books, newspapers, or the internet, we want everything to be clear and easy to read. But researchers have discovered that one of the best ways to remember something you’ve read is to read it in a weird font. The size and boldness makes no difference, although the harder it is to read, the better. When something is unfamiliar and difficult to read, you are forced to concentrate on it more, allowing you to remember it easier. 

 Large, bold fonts may actually hurt your ability to remember, as studies found that when asked to memorize a list of words, people predicted they would recall bold words easier than non-bold words, and therefore studied them less, leading to the opposite result.  

## Write things out 

Make notes and refine them to learn things better and find something compelling about a topic and follow that compelling thing. Also, try to study 30 minutes on 30 minutes off for 2 hours. When reading for retention, summarize each paragraph in the margin. 

## Presentation Tip 

Say only three things in sentences, try to explain something difficult thing in different ways and maybe multiple times
