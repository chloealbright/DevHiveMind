Comments: The motivation behind this regimen is basically how I would prepare and practice challenges if I had not done one before and written in a way to avoid anti patterns I fell into.

## Prep  
*Master algorithms get to the point were you can solve within 5 to 20 min or show your breath of knowledge within the time-frame of the interview  
>[!note] 
>Look on Glassdoor, and then checking Reddit and Quora you can also check their employees on LinkedIn and see if you have any mutual connections you can try to connect to find out about the type of interview question

1. **Focus on One Problem**: 
	- Identify problem area.
	- Pick one problem something simple like an array question or something.
	- Read problems and break them down to understand, don't solve practice doing this until you feel comfortable then revisit and solve. 
	- Keep in mind when to change [[Approach Pivot |Approach]]
	- ***Consider Pair Programming when you get to the point were your good at implementing Optimal solutions or Naive solutions or once you fill that you have enough repetition***
  
2. [[AlgoFlow#**Brute Force Algorithm** |Bruteforce]] **Solution**:  
	- Come up with a Bruteforce solution to gain insight into the problem's dynamics.  
	- Break the problem down until you understand it think about the [[Algo pathway |Attributes of Data]] being passed.  
  
3. [[AlgoFlow#**Naïve Algorithm** |Naive]] **Solution**:  
	- Develop a naive solution, distinct from the Bruteforce approach.  
	- Space out attempts, allowing time for fresh perspectives.
	- The Naive solution can be done [[Common Imperative Algorithms |Imperatively]] or [[Common Declarative Algorithms |Declarative]] consider doing both ways to see if you can do it.
	- Also think about [[All Sorts of Sorts |Sorting]] algorithms in terms what can be applied, you don't necessarily need write one but you can use a pre-made sorting algorithm.
	- Lastly consider runtime complexity and data structures brainstorming thinking about their application in terms of access, searching, insertion, and deletion both [[Linear Data Structure Runtime Comparison |Linear]] and [[Non-Linear Data Structure Runtime Comparison |Non-Linear]]

  
4. [[AlgoFlow#**Optimal Algorithm** |Optimal]] **Solution & [[Key Base Attributes of  Grokking Algorithm patterns |Grokking Algorithm]] Patterns**:
	- Develop a Optimal approach
	- Consider experiment with looping [[Linear Iteration vs Linear Recursion  vs Binary Iteration vs Binary Recursion |iteratively]] and [[Recursion & Recursion Runtime |recursively]].  
	- Delve into advanced algorithm patterns for solution. 
	- Think about what patterns can be used for the problem which can be solved with many different patterns depending on the problem itself.
	- Keep in mind that one pattern may be more Optimal then the other depending on the specifics of the problem.
	- Create helper functions for code modularity also implementing proper [[Naming Conventions]]. 


## Order of Patterns to Focus on 
Two Pointer
Fast Slow Pointer
Sliding Window
Do backtracking before dynamic programming

## Problem Types to Focus On
When tackling coding challenges, the emphasis is often on creating or solving functions (around 80% of the time) rather than dealing with Object Oriented (OO) problems, which occur less frequently in my experience. For a comprehensive interview preparation, allocate around 70-80% of your time to coding challenges, especially if you're new to technical interviews. System design interviews, comprising 20-30%, are more common in larger companies like Bloomberg, Spotify, Google, and Direct TV, while startups may have a different emphasis depending on the job level. Keep in mind that platforms like LeetCode cover a range of problems, including some that involve implementing classes or Object Oriented concepts. You may want to consider sometime for side projects or exploring some new technology as well this all depends on your level of proficiency and your current stage of your career like from my under standing senior developers don't get the standard Leetcode type interview. 


**Object-Oriented (OO) Problems Example (20%):**
1. Design a class hierarchy for a zoo with different animal types.
2. Implement a basic banking system with classes for accounts, transactions, and customers.
3. Create a class for a deck of cards with methods for shuffling and dealing.
4. Design a class structure for a simple 2D game with characters, enemies, and items.
5. Implement a class-based solution for a car rental system with cars, customers, and rentals.

**Function-Based Problems Example (80%):**
1. Write a function to find the factorial of a given number.
2. Implement a function to check if a string is a palindrome.
3. Create a function to find the largest element in an array.
4. Write a function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
5. Implement a function to reverse a linked list.
6. Design a function that returns the common elements between two arrays.
7. Create a function to check if a number is prime.
8. Write a function to merge two sorted arrays.
9. Implement a function to validate a Sudoku board.
10. Design a function to calculate the area of different geometric shapes.

This mix allows for practicing both the principles of object-oriented design and the development of algorithmic and logical problem-solving skills through functions.
