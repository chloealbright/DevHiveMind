1. Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application. It encapsulates the data and provides methods for manipulating and accessing that data.
    
2. View: Represents the user interface components that the user interacts with. It is responsible for displaying data to the user and capturing user input.
    
3. ViewModel: Serves as the intermediary between the View and the Model. It contains the presentation logic and exposes data and commands that the View binds to. The ViewModel transforms the data from the Model into a format that can be easily consumed by the View.
    

In the MVVM pattern, the View is kept separate from the underlying data and logic (Model), which promotes separation of concerns and improves the maintainability and testability of the codebase. The ViewModel acts as a bridge between the View and the Model, handling data transformations, user input, and updating the Model as necessary.

Overall, MVVM is a popular architectural pattern for building modern GUI applications and provides a structured way to handle the complexities of user interfaces while maintaining separation between different components.
