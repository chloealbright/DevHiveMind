Take A Class on Negotiation my number Range is 91,000 to 130,000

let the company lead the conversation a little let them give you a lot of info before giving some  
  
5000 to 9500 per month minimum  
  
Or  
  
31 to 60 an hour  
  
47 to 57 an hour  
  
35 an hour is about 68,000 a year  
  
  
5,687.5 a month  
  
If 3 month internship about 16,000  
  
  
  
Avoid sounding greedy  
  
it is harder to negotiate while in the company but not impossible but do good initially before entering company  
  
About how you need a certain amount for the salary base pay because you have a family etc just provide reasons  
  
  
Ask for roll budgets allocated for role  
  
my number 91,000  
  
Let them know I know that the average starting salary is in this range or  
  
based on my research i would say looking for something in this range  
  
do a little more research reach out to recruiters or people at the company  
  
Give a range not a number ask for 10 to 15% more than the initial price, but ask for an offer  
  
Also the larger the company the more space to negotiate so maybe bigger number  
  
my range is 91,000 to 105,000  
  
104,650  
  
10% of 91,000 is 100,100  
  
7% of 91,000 is 97,370  
  
5% of 91,000 is 95,550  
  
if not your number or in your range tell them this is below my range expectation and was just wondering  
  
what is the money budgeted for the role and  
  
were do i fall in the salary range as a new under-grad and recent coding bootcamp grad vs some one with a year or two experiences in the industry or more experience but from a different industry  
  
ask if there is any room in salary range they mention if it is not what your looking for  
  
Also if they give you a number and you're not sure about it tell them that you appreciate the offer but need some time to think it over because you want to work there for a long time but I wanna talk with your family or you have other offers to weigh but ask how mush time you have to consider things  
  
negotiate from a lower salary meaning you take a lower amount than your range but can get the opportunity to renegotiate sooner than their regular time like 3 months  
  
if they ask about your last salary which is illegal deflect and say can we talk on the role like what does day by day look like and the companies culture and team because I would like to learn and understand more about the company commit to a number or you can say you worked in another industry  
  
Or say I don't want compensation to be a limiting factor but would rather get to know the team first but I'm happy to discuss it later  
  
  
Especially if they're not a recruiter  
  
  
If dealing with a recruiter and they asked you about the money ask them what range did you have in mind for the role or what was a typical range for the role  
  
If their number is higher tell them yes thank you for sharing this is something that I'm looking to obtain  
  
Or if it's lower tell them thank you for sharing but I'm actually looking for this range but I don't want this to be a sticking point early in the process can we revisit this later on  
  
If they don't share the arrange you can tell them I'm looking for a this range I'm open to understanding what the team is willing to offer for the role  
  
do research on role and company  
  
read offer letter before sign there can sus things  
  
  
Excuses in negotiations to get more money  
  
tell them based on what your offering in the time will it take to do it will take away from the time I have for my other projects etc... so I was wondering would this be possible...  
  
  
Handling multiple offers  
---------  
  
Let other companies know that you just received an offer to create urgency for them to get more money possibly remember  
  
Say hello name of company I just want to give you an update on my interview process I just received an offer from another company name that is strong with that said I'm really excited to work with your company I had a very good time interviewing with you and I really wanted to see make things work since my timeline is compressed with this new offer is there anything we can do to speed up the process  
  
Always know when a deadline is to respond to offer some companies try to rush you so think before you accept if you want to work with them they are rushing you don't forget to mention that you waiting for other offers with other companies  
  
Make sure you know the salary you want and go higher going in and also come in with your negotiables if you don't get the price you want  
  
Find out what value you can provide and list them  
  
  
Things to consider  
  
Is an offer that you feel like you are under qualified for  
  
The harder position is probably the better one because you learn a lot and grow more but when you leave it looks good on your resume to get a potential higher pay at another company so consider it  
  
Long-term growth potential  
The People  
Salary and benefits  
  
And are you desperate which you are but differentiate between the degrees for each company  
  
  
Raises  
-------  
Plan out your career path in the company  
Be a good employee  
Actually ask  
Show don't tell make a proposal or presentation  
  
Keep track of everything that you do and organize it into a folder or presentation show later down the line  
  
When negotiating I'm going back and forth with numbers when they go lower ask them how about you do this number then after 90 days if my performance is good you bump it up to this price  
  
  
Problem solved ,emails ,money saved, comment from some clients, improved skills, and what you want to learn next ask for higher than you want about 10,000  
  
Always get a copy of a contract  
  
talk more professional  
  
google starting up a conversation  
  
When employer ask you about salary say fair market value if they continue to say you need to look into it  
  
Don't speak first in negotiations  
  
Do voice notes  
  
Don't answer immediately  
  
say you have offers 10k more than there offer  
  
justify raise ask how  
  
ask a lot of how questions  
like how am I post to do something if I'm doing more work of another employee that was fired?  
  
get the employer to say no  
  
use specific numbers talk about the math  
also tell the employer, not to hire someone else it will be cheaper to give me a little more  
  
mirror what they say the last couple of words and leave pause basically leaving space for the employer to speak giving you more info to use in negotiation  
  
Make a long list of demands for negotiations  
  
Make them feel powerless  
  
You silence a lot  
  
ask the boss to meet up to talk about a raise or before an annual performance review or promotion  
  
also, the supervisor who you talk to has to get run it to their boss  
  
talk about market rate  
stay away from negative  
  
Ask questions  
● What is your style of supervision like?  
● What does success in this role look like?  
  
Document  
● When you reach or exceed your goals (resume!)  
● Where you are struggling (growth! interviews!)  
  
Be observant  
● What meetings are they sitting in on? Are you interested in learning more about what else they do?  
● Ask them to lunch!  
  
Ask if there’s anything else you can help with before you leave for the day  
● Small thing. Big pay off.  
  
  
  
Things to remember

If you can't walk away from a negotiation then you aren't negotiating you just working out the terms of your slavery also look for courses on wealth management

Ask for advice  
  
Be prepared to walk away otherwise it's slavery  
  
Don't let recruiters know how much you made previously ask them about the range before they bring it up  
  
If you make an above the range and you going to another place where it's lower, mention your range and acts if they can meet it or somewhere in the middle if they really want you they will try more

Best Books on How to Negotiate  
------------------------------------------------------  
1. Getting More  
Subtitle: How You Can Negotiate to Succeed in Work and Life  
  
Author: Stuart Diamond  
  
Why It's Worth Reading: The book challenges a lot of the common conceptions about negotiating, including the famous win-win bromides and the "BATNA" (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement) theory. Rather than attempting to impose a solution through the use of power, this book starts from the viewpoint that the other person's emotions and perceptions must be respected and negotiated towards.  
  
Best Quote: "Whenever almost anything, don't you wonder if there's more? It doesn't have to mean more for me and less for you. Just has to be, well, more. And it doesn't necessarily mean more money. It means more of whatever you value: more money, more time, more food, more travel, more responsibility, more basketball, more TV, more music. This book is about more: how you define it, how you get it, how you keep it."  
  
2. Crucial Conversations  
Subtitle: Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High  
  
Authors: Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan, and Al Switzler  
  
Why It's Worth Reading: Because this is a general book about communicating effectively, it's perfect for people who don't normally negotiate. It emphasizes preparation, creating a safe environment to speak, and "transforming unpleasant emotions into powerful dialog" through persuasion rather than demands.  
  
Best Quote: "Despite the importance of crucial conversations, we often back away from them because we fear we'll make matters worse. We've become masters at avoiding tough conversations. Coworkers send e-mail to each other when they should walk down the hall and talk turkey. Bosses leave voice mail in lieu of meeting with their direct reports. Family members change the subject with an issue gets too risky. We use all kinds of tactics to dodge touchy issues."  
  
3. Influence  
Subtitle: The Psychology of Persuasion  
  
Author: Robert B. Cialdini  
  
Why It's Worth Reading: More than the other books in this collection, Influence is about sales negotiations. It lays out the psychology of positioning prior to a sales negotiation as well as the specific formulae that drive a sales negotiation to a successful conclusion. A must read and one of my all-time favorites.  
  
Best Quote: "It is much more profitable for salespeople to present the expensive item first, not only because to fail to do so will lose the influence of the contrast principle; to fail to do so will also cause the principle to work actively against them. Presenting an inexpensive product first and following it with an expensive one will cause the expensive item to seem even more costly as a result."  
  
4. Bargaining for Advantage  
Subtitle: Negotiation Strategies for Reasonable People  
  
Author: G. Richard Shell  
  
Why It's Worth Reading: This book starts from the idea that you must first "know thyself" before you try to negotiate with others. It identifies five styles of negotiating and provides tools to help you understand which ones work for you under different circumstances. As a result, the book is a good prerequisite for making the best use of the other books in this list.  
  
Best Quote: "Your personal negotiation style is a critical variable in bargaining. If you don't know what your instincts and intuitions will tell you to do under different conditions, you will have a great deal of trouble planning effective strategies and responses."  
  
5. Getting to Yes  
Subtitle: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In  
  
Authors: Roger Fisher, William L. Ury, and Bruce Patton  
  
Why It's Worth Reading: Beyond doubt, this is the most influential book on negotiating ever written, so much so that most business readers will already be familiar with its basic concept, the proverbial "win-win" negotiation.  
  
Best Quote: "The method of principled negotiation is to decide issues on their merits rather than through a haggling process focused on what each side says it will and won't do. It suggests that you look for mutual gains whenever possible and that where you interests conflict, you should insist that the result be based upon some fair standards independent of the will of either side."  
  
6. Never Split the Difference  
Subtitle: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It  
  
Authors: Chris Voss and Tahl Raz  
  
Why It's Worth Reading: This book is largely a reaction to, and against, the conventional wisdom in Getting to Yes. Rather than assuming that people understand their own interests and act according to them, the writers approach the negotiation process as a phenomenon that's only understood as a set of essentially irrational and emotional responses.  
  
Best Quote: "When business schools began teaching negotiation in the 1980s, the process was presented as a straightforward economic analysis. It was a period when the world's top academic economists declared that we were all 'rational actors.' And so it went in negotiation classes: assuming the other side was acting rationally and selfishly in trying to maximize its position, the goal was to figure out how to respond in various scenarios to maximize one's own value. [However,] humans all suffer from Cognitive Bias, that is, unconscious--and irrational--brain processes that literally distort the way we see the world."  
  
7. Kiss, Bow, or Shake Hands  
Subtitle: The Bestselling Guide to Doing Business in More Than 60 Countries  
  
Authors: Terri Morrison and Wayne A. Conaway  
  
Why It's Worth Reading: Finally, there's no doubt that negotiating styles differ from country to country. This book helps you understand the thought processes and protocols that you'll encounter while dealing with a global economy. Indispensable stuff.  
  
Best Quote: "Many global executives adopt the manners of their targeted countries, so why do U.S. executives need to study foreign ways? There are a variety of reasons. First of all, many foreign businesspeople often cannot or will not imitate U.S. mannerisms. Can you afford to leave them out of your business plans? Second, you might wish to sell to the general public in a foreign market. The average foreign consumer is certainly not going to have the same habits and tastes as consumers in the United States of America. Third, although our friend Josef may act and sound like an American or Canadian or Australian, he isn't. He probably is not even thinking in English; he is thinking in German. Knowing how Germans tend to arrive a decisions gives you an edge. And don't we all need every business advantage we can get?"
