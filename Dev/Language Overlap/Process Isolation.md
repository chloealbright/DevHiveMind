Each process in the application should be isolated, stateless, and independent of other processes. This enables horizontal scalability and fault tolerance. If one process becomes unhealthy or unresponsive, it can be terminated and replaced without affecting the overall application.

Process isolation, in the context of the 12-factor app, refers to the practice of keeping each application process independent and self-contained. Each process should not rely on shared states or resources with other processes, promoting a stateless design. This approach enhances scalability, fault tolerance, and ease of deployment and maintenance.

In Java, process isolation can be achieved through various mechanisms, such as using threads, separate JVM instances, or microservices architecture. Here, we'll demonstrate a simple example of process isolation using threads.

Let's consider a basic Java program that simulates a simple web server. The server receives HTTP requests and responds with a message containing the current timestamp. We'll create a thread for each incoming request to handle it separately, ensuring process isolation.

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpExchange;
import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpHandler;
import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer;

public class SimpleWebServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        // Create an HTTP server on port 8080
        HttpServer server = HttpServer.create(new InetSocketAddress(8080), 0);
        
        // Set up a context for handling requests
        server.createContext("/", new MyHandler());
        
        // Start the server
        System.out.println("Server started. Listening on port 8080.");
        server.start();
    }

    // Custom HTTP handler
    static class MyHandler implements HttpHandler {
        @Override
        public void handle(HttpExchange exchange) throws IOException {
            // Create a new thread to handle the request
            Thread requestHandler = new Thread(() -> {
                try {
                    handleRequest(exchange);
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            });

            // Start the thread to handle the request
            requestHandler.start();
        }
    }

    // Method to handle the HTTP request
    private static void handleRequest(HttpExchange exchange) throws IOException {
        String response = "Hello, the current timestamp is: " + System.currentTimeMillis();
        exchange.sendResponseHeaders(200, response.length());
        OutputStream outputStream = exchange.getResponseBody();
        outputStream.write(response.getBytes());
        outputStream.close();
    }
}
```

In this example, we use `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer`, which is available in the Java SE standard library since Java 1.6. The server listens on port 8080 for incoming HTTP requests. When a request is received, the `MyHandler` class is responsible for handling it. Instead of processing the request in the same thread, we create a new thread for each request using `Thread`.

By using threads, we achieve process isolation because each request is handled in its separate thread, and the state of one request does not affect another. This approach enables the application to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently and independently.

Keep in mind that this is a basic example, and in a real-world scenario, you may use more advanced techniques like thread pooling, asynchronous processing, or a full-fledged framework or library for building web servers in Java. However, the fundamental concept of process isolation remains the same: handling requests separately to ensure independence and scalability.
