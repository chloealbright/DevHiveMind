Use cases and User stories are both techniques used in software development to capture and describe requirements, but they have some differences.

## User stories
User stories are typically short, informal descriptions of a feature or functionality from an end user's perspective and are part of Agile methodologies, emphasizing collaboration and adaptability.

### User Story Structure:  
"As a `[user type]`, I want` [an action]` so that `[benefit/value]`."  
  
#### Example:  
"As a website visitor, I want to easily reset my password so that I can regain access to my account."  

## Use cases
Use cases are more detailed and structured descriptions of how a system interacts with an external entity, usually a user, to achieve a specific goal. They include a main success scenario and alternative scenarios to cover different paths the system may take and are often presented in a formalized format with step-by-step actions and potential variations. Use cases are also part of various software development methodologies, including both Agile and traditional approaches.

### Use Case Structure:  
1. **Title:** Describes the goal of the use case.  
2. **Actors:** Identifies the individuals or systems interacting with the system.  
3. **Preconditions:** Describes the state of the system before the use case begins.  
4. **Main Success Scenario:** Presents the steps and interactions leading to the successful accomplishment of the goal.  
5. **Alternative Scenarios:** Describes possible deviations from the main success scenario, often including error handling or exceptional situations.  
6. **Post-conditions:** Describes the state of the system after the use case is completed.  
  
#### Example:  
**Title:** Reset Password  
**Actors:** Website Visitor, System  
**Preconditions:** The user is on the login page.  
**Main Success Scenario:**  
1. User clicks on "Forgot Password" link.  
2. System prompts user for email.  
3. User enters email and submits the form.  
4. System sends a password reset email.  
5. User follows the link in the email to reset the password.  
**Alternative Scenarios:**  
- If the email is not valid, display an error message.  
- If the email is not received, provide a resend option.  
**Post-conditions:** User's password is successfully reset.  
  
In summary, a user story is a concise, user-centric statement, while a use case provides a detailed, structured description of system interactions with various scenarios and conditions. The use case structure captures a more comprehensive view of a specific system functionality.
