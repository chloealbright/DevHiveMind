System design has many scopes and focuses  
  
Like you can be planning out the design for your technology requirements like how will your devs be interfacing with the code base should you use containerization and implement docker so people could just run docker images so they'll be less issues with running the code in their environment things like that versus other things  
  
  
Like business specific requirements and the data associated with it from a schema level or to extend that from a web server endpoint and the crud functionality and so on  
  
Even focusing on the build of your code  
  
Or the DevOps process
