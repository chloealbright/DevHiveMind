The life cycle of practicing Domain-Driven Design (DDD) for an application involves several key phases:  
  
1. **Discovery and Understanding:**  
- **Identifying the Domain:** Understand the problem space and identify the core domain of the application.  
- **Ubiquitous Language:** Develop a shared and consistent language that both technical and non-technical team members can use to discuss the domain.  
  
2. **Modeling:**  
- **Aggregate Roots and Entities:** Identify and define aggregate roots and entities that represent the key business concepts.  
- **Value Objects:** Recognize and model value objects, which are objects without identity that are defined by their attributes.  
- **Bounded Contexts:** Clearly define boundaries between different parts of the system with separate contexts.  
  
3. **Strategic Design:**  
- **Context Mapping:** Establish how different bounded contexts interact and communicate with each other.  
- **Domain Vision and Core Domain:** Clarify the overall vision for the domain and identify the core domain that adds the most business value.  
  
4. **Tactical Design:**  
- **Aggregate Design:** Refine and design aggregates, defining consistency boundaries and transactional scopes.  
- **Repositories:** Determine how to persist and retrieve aggregates.  
- **Services:** Identify services that perform operations not naturally fit within the aggregate boundaries.  
  
5. **Implementation:**  
- **Code the Domain Model:** Translate the designed model into code, ensuring that the code closely aligns with the conceptual model.  
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Use TDD to write tests that validate the correctness of the domain logic.  
  
6. **Continuous Refinement:**  
- **Feedback Loop:** Continuously gather feedback from domain experts, stakeholders, and team members to refine the model.  
- **Evolution:** Be prepared to evolve the domain model as the understanding of the business domain deepens over time.  
  
7. **Integration with Application Services:**  
- **Application Layer:** Integrate the domain model with application services and other layers of the application.  
- **UI Integration:** Connect the domain model to the user interface.  
  
8. **Deployment and Maintenance:**  
- **Release and Deployment:** Deploy the application with the refined domain model.  
- **Monitoring and Maintenance:** Continuously monitor the application and make adjustments to the domain model as needed to address changing business requirements.  
  
9. **Documentation:**  
- **Documentation Updates:** Keep documentation up-to-date to reflect the evolving understanding of the domain and the implemented model.  
  
10. **Scaling and Optimization:**  
- **Optimization:** Identify opportunities for performance optimization as the application scales.  
- **Scalability:** Ensure that the domain model scales appropriately with the growth of the application.  
  
The life cycle of practicing DDD is iterative and involves a constant feedback loop, allowing for the refinement and improvement of the domain model over time.
