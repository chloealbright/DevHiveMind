Dear [Company] Recruitment,

Having delved into your company's commitment to [Company Value or Goal], I am enthusiastic about applying for the Full-Stack Engineer position. With a background in developing and maintaining web applications, complemented by my experience as a Business Systems Analyst (BSA), I am confident in my ability to excel in this role. I'm passionate about strategic thinking, such as crafting a data model. I see numerous parallels in how an architect plans a construction projectâ€”starting with a blueprint before transforming it into a tangible structure. This is why I consider myself a software Carpenter, on the journey to becoming a software architect.

At TracFlo, I successfully delivered 13+ features, empowering 50+ general contractors and subcontracting companies to manage projects with up to 35+ active users, each with varying roles. Notably, I contributed to a feature facilitating the creation, editing, and retrieval of equipment and materials within a ticket, averaging 135+ tickets per company project. This experience honed my algorithmic thinking, a skill seamlessly applied during my tenure as a Business Systems Analyst at TD Bank, where I translated business requirements into efficient technical specifications.

My collaboration with Cre8tive Dev Software at TD Bank further showcased the importance of algorithmic thinking. In just 5 months, I supported the upskilling of over 200+ software engineers across 10 cohorts, spanning technologies like Advanced Java, Spring Boot, Docker, Event-Driven Architecture, and Reactive Programming. I also created technical documentation and assisted engineers in setting up environments for tools like WSL and Docker.

I am eager to bring my skills and experience to [Company] and contribute to its success. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing in more detail how I can contribute to your team.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
