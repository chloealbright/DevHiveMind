Non-binary trees, also known as non-binary trees or n-ary trees, are tree structures where nodes can have more than two children. There are various types of non-binary trees, and some of the common ones include:  
  
1. **Ternary Tree:** A ternary tree is a type of non-binary tree where each node has up to three children.  
  
2. **Quadtree:** A quadtree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. It is often used in computer graphics for spatial partitioning and collision detection.  
  
3. **Octree:** An octree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly eight children. It is used in three-dimensional spatial partitioning for applications like computer graphics and 3D modeling.  
  
4. **B-tree:** A B-tree is a balanced tree structure that allows for a variable number of children per node. It is commonly used in databases and file systems to maintain sorted data efficiently.  
  
5. **Trie (Prefix Tree):** A trie is a tree-like data structure used for storing a dynamic set of strings or keys. It is commonly used in applications like IP routing, spell checkers, and implementing data structures like dictionaries.  
  
6. **Splay Tree:** A splay tree is a self-adjusting binary search tree, but it can be considered a non-binary tree in the sense that nodes are restructured based on access patterns. It reshapes itself to bring frequently accessed elements closer to the root for faster future access.  
  
7. **General Trees:** General trees are a broad category of trees where nodes can have any number of children. They do not have a fixed maximum number of children per node, making them very versatile for representing hierarchical data structures.  
  
These are some common examples of non-binary trees, but there are many more variations and specialized tree structures used in various applications. The choice of non-binary tree depends on the specific problem and the nature of the data you need to represent or organize.
