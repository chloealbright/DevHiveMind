Currently trading cash not mutual funds  
  
Cash account has settlement time  
  
You're not restricted to pattern day trading and it's not a margin account which can be very restrictive  
  
Margin accounts has pattern day trading below 25k and there is instant settlement and margin  
  
So you are restricted if you buy multiple times after a certain amount of times you can't until the next week or something  
  
The main difference between cash and margin is the cash as your own cash and margin is a loan from the broker what using their money and you're restricted to certain amount of trades unless you're above 25k
