The Annual Dividend per Share refers to the total amount of dividends paid by a company to its shareholders over a year, divided by the total number of shares outstanding. It represents the dividend income an investor would receive for each share they own.

On the other hand, the Dividend Payout Ratio is a financial metric that measures the proportion of a company's earnings that are distributed as dividends to shareholders. It is calculated by dividing the total dividends paid by the company by its net income. The ratio indicates the percentage of earnings that is allocated to dividends rather than being retained by the company for reinvestment or other purposes.

In summary, the Annual Dividend per Share represents the actual dividend payment per share, while the Dividend Payout Ratio indicates the portion of earnings that is distributed as dividends.





Certainly! Let's assume we have a company that has a net income of $500,000 and pays out dividends totaling $200,000 to its shareholders. To calculate the Dividend Payout Ratio, you would use the following formula:

Dividend Payout Ratio = Dividends / Net Income

In this case, the Dividend Payout Ratio would be:

Dividend Payout Ratio = $200,000 / $500,000

Dividend Payout Ratio = 0.4 or 40%

This means that the company distributed 40% of its net income as dividends to its shareholders. The remaining 60% ($300,000) would be retained by the company for reinvestment or other purposes.



  
To determine the dividend payout for a shareholder with 1 share, you would need to know the dividend per share. The dividend per share represents the amount of dividend paid out for each individual share.

Let's assume that the dividend per share is $5. In this case, the dividend payout for a shareholder with 1 share would be:

Dividend Payout = Dividend per Share * Number of Shares

Dividend Payout = $5 * 1

Dividend Payout = $5

So, for a shareholder with 1 share and a dividend per share of $5, the dividend payout would be $5.
