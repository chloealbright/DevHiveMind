Agile is a mindset where you apply different frameworks like scrum which is a iterative and incremental agile software development framework for managing product development 

You have a product backlog that flows into Sprint backlog after Sprint planning 

> [!note] Status
> Committed
> Uncommitted
> Unplanned 

Planning out documentations start something in one medium and then render it down to another and another until you reach the final form on the last platform an example of this is Excel spreadsheet PowerPoint to confluence/jira  

  There's also kanban 

Kanban is news for projects where a lot of things already defined and established  These can limit wip(work in progress)  Kanban and Sprint both use kanban board     

Scrum is used more when projects are relatively newer and things aren't as defined and are in the process of being defined    

 Plans change a lot they change for 2 weeks or a quarterly basis even annual   Balance rate of change like if you add a new feature to a program it can have catastrophic effects so you slowly do it by doing pre-work or post-work or planning out that to handle the change  In order to do this you need be able to react to the change maintain stability account for a time to value maintain performance while being available and pushing innovation  In the short term the quality of a service can go up with disability but the time to value may decrease going this way would be you creating smaller incremental changes at a fast pace    Doing this long-term increases delivery speed and lowers cost   Agile isn't only specific to software development It can be applied outside of development   Teams have seven to nine core team members which will probably include developers and also BSA and maybe some other  Quality members on usually engaging in a lot of activities that's what distinguishes between others   Team can consists of 

One product owner One agile lead 3 to 5 engineers One to two test developers BSA can sometime be in and out of a few projects  Might have Architect Delivery engineer  Or The architect can play some of the other roles like BSA  A Specialist may come in and out of a project team



You can have features and acceptance state across multiple PI plan before moving into in progress for the pre-PI planning stage  

The in progress state covers two stages first it covers the feature during disaggregation into epics and stories during the pre-PI planning stage in progress also covers the feature during the building stage of the feature during the PI  

If the feature covers multiple PIs only the component of the feature for the upcoming PI is disaggregated during the pre-PI planning stage  

When features are done they can either be completed declined or canceled  

Aspect of a feature   

Out of scope functionality  

Non-functional requirements  nice to haves

Analysis or marketing summary  


Vendor analysis is  

Incremental implementation strategy  

Any other information pertinent to prioritizing or building the Feature





### Agile vs Scrum

Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. 

The benefit of Agile is the software development life cycle that has a structured series of stages that a product goes through as it moves from beginning to end. It contains the phases: plan, design, launch, develop, test, deploy, and review. The roles of Agile consist of Product Owner, Developer, Team Leader, Technical and Domain Experts, Integrator, Independent Testers, and Auditors. 

The tools used in agile consist of Jira, VersionOne, Planbox, Lean Kit, Pivotal Tracker, Axosoft, Active Colab, and Taiga. The fundamental artifacts of the Agile framework consist of a specific approach to planning, managing, and executing work. The scope of Agile frameworks typically falls into two categories: Frameworks designed for teams, and frameworks designed to help organizations practice Agile at scale, across many teams. 

Scrum is a framework for project management commonly used in software development, although it has been used in other fields including research, sales, marketing, and advanced technologies. There are 5 phases within Scrum: product backlog creation, sprint planning, working on the Sprint, testing/demonstrating, and retrospective. 

The benefits of Scrum help people and teams deliver value incrementally in a collaborative way. As an agile framework, Scrum provides just enough structure for people and teams to integrate into how they work, while adding the right practices to optimize for their specific needs. 

The roles of Scrum are very similar to Agile. They can consist of the Product Owner, the Scrum Master, and the Development Team Members. The teamwork involved consists of sprints that lay out the plan for production. This includes the scope of the production process to produce product backlog items. 

The scrum tools consist of Jira, VivifyScrum, Targetprocess, Scrumwise, QuickScrum, and more! 

Scrum describes three primary artifacts: the Product Backlog, the Sprint Backlog, and the Product Increment.
