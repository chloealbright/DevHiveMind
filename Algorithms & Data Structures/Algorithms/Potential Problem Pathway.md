The choice between identifying data structures or exploring built-in functions first can depend on the specific nature of the problem and your familiarity with the available data structures and functions. However, a common and effective approach is to identify potential data structures first. Here's why:  
  
1. **Understanding the Problem Domain:**  
- Identifying data structures helps you understand the problem domain and how you can represent and manipulate the data efficiently. It provides a foundation for building a solution that aligns with the problem's requirements.  
  
2. **Algorithm Design:**  
- Selecting appropriate data structures guides the high-level algorithm design. It helps you outline the logical steps and operations needed to solve the problem before diving into specific function implementations.  
  
3. **Flexibility in Solution Approach:**  
- By identifying data structures early, you have the flexibility to choose and design algorithms based on your understanding of the problem. This can lead to more creative and efficient solutions.  
  
4. **Built-in Functions Alignment:**  
- Once you've identified data structures, you can explore relevant built-in functions or methods that align with those structures. This approach allows you to leverage functions that directly complement the chosen data structures.  
  
5. **Runtime Complexity Consideration:**  
- Understanding the runtime complexity of your chosen data structures helps you make informed decisions about the efficiency of your solution. You can then select built-in functions with awareness of their impact on the overall complexity.  
  
That said, there may be cases where exploring built-in functions early can provide insights into efficient solutions or help simplify the algorithm. It's essential to strike a balance and adapt your approach based on the problem's characteristics and your familiarity with potential data structures and functions.  
  
In summary, while the identification of data structures generally precedes exploring built-in functions, the key is to maintain flexibility and adapt your approach based on the specific requirements and constraints of each problem.
