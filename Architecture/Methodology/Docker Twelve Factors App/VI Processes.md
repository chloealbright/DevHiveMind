Processes: Your app should be executed as one or more stateless processes. Docker containers are designed to be lightweight, isolated, and stateless, making it easier to scale and manage multiple instances of the app and it process. A single container should run a single foreground process, and you can use multiple containers to run the various pieces of a more complex application. 

## Type of Processes 
[[Stateless & Statefull Processes ]]
[[XII Admin processes]]
[[VIII Concurrency]]

1. Web Server Process: A web server process handles incoming HTTP requests and serves corresponding responses. Examples include processes running Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, or Microsoft IIS.

2. Application Server Process: An application server process hosts and executes server-side application logic. It provides services such as transaction management, connection pooling, and resource sharing. Examples include processes running Tomcat, JBoss, or WildFly.

3. Worker Process: A worker process performs background tasks or processes queued jobs asynchronously. It handles tasks that are not tied to immediate user requests, such as generating reports, sending emails, or performing scheduled maintenance.

4. Database Process: A database process manages connections, executes queries, and handles data storage and retrieval. Examples include processes running MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Oracle Database.

5. Cache Server Process: A cache server process stores frequently accessed data in memory to improve application performance. Examples include processes running Redis, Memcached, or Hazelcast.

6. Message Queue Consumer Process: A message queue consumer process listens for messages in a message queue and processes them asynchronously. It facilitates communication and coordination between different components of a distributed system.

7. Background Task Scheduler Process: A background task scheduler process manages scheduled tasks, ensuring they are executed at specified intervals. It can trigger various actions, such as data backups, periodic data processing, or running maintenance scripts.

8. Logging Process: A logging process collects and stores log data generated by the application. It may aggregate logs from multiple sources and forward them to a centralized logging system for analysis and monitoring.
