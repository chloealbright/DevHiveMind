Grill Your Interviewers - Always ask Who When Why

	A common trope people throw around is “you’re interviewing them as much as they’re interviewing you.” I say if that’s true, then put them through the goddamn wringer. You should learn as much as possible about the kind of people who work here. see how they respond to your questions

	Reason - It’s going to give you a lot more insight into the company than any generic question will. It gives you some momentum in the interview. Instead of constantly being on the defensive, by asking tough questions, you get some time to breathe while your interviewer reacts to your questions. It’s also just more interesting!
