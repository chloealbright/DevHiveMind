## Points Math
Pay off both credit cards on the first of each month  
  
  
20,000 points for Chase is about 200  
  
  
100 points equals a dollar  
  
You got two cent back for every dollar you spend on Fidelity  
  
  
So multiply the cost of your bill each month by each month in the year  
  
  
Then multiply that by the cents per dollar  
  
  
0.02 × annual cost of bill or expense equals how much money you get back  
  
  
You basically got $0.02 for each cent you spend  
  
  
Need to spend 40,000 on Fidelity in order to make it worth it over credit cards that have sign up bonuses with what points like 20,000  
  
  
About 834 a month for 4 years  
  
  
Fidelity points spend $400 you get about 800 points which is equivalent to $8 can you wait  
  
  
Coinbase is like 0.04 cents




## Freezing your credit score will hurt you  
- Now it credit freeze is basically putting your credit score on pause  
- Meaning that lenders cant extend you credit and that you can improve your credit temporarily  
- Now this is actually a good thing  
  
Here is why:  
- Fraud: say you are about to apply for a mortgage and you got all your documents in order but all of sudden some fraud comes into your credit report, that someone took a loan out in Florida under your name. ( but you live in California – by freezing your credit, that scammer would have never been able to take a credit line in your name)  
  
- How to: You have to call all 3 credit BEARUOUS and ask them to freeze your score, and verify your identity.  
- It's also free  
  
Tip: its something I would do this, when I have something important coming up, and the last thing I want is some unknown situation happening.


## Professionals can Fix your Score  
- In reality,yes, but you can also do it yourself  
- Most of these people are just putting your account on default and then negotiating down the price  
- But it will trash your credit score temporarily  
  
The Best thing to do:  
- Is follow the 2 rules  
- Don’t spend money that you don’t have on a credit card  
- And pay it off in full every month to avoid interest  
- If you do that you’ll never have to worry about negating debt.
