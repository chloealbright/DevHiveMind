In Java, a byte stream is a sequence of bytes used for reading from or writing to a source or destination. It provides a low-level, fundamental way of handling binary data.

The `java.io` package in Java provides several classes for working with byte streams. Here are some commonly used byte stream classes:

1. InputStream: This abstract class is the superclass of all classes representing input streams. It provides methods for reading bytes from a source.

2. OutputStream: This abstract class is the superclass of all classes representing output streams. It provides methods for writing bytes to a destination.

3. FileInputStream: This class is a subclass of InputStream and is used to read bytes from a file.

4. FileOutputStream: This class is a subclass of OutputStream and is used to write bytes to a file.

5. ByteArrayInputStream: This class is a subclass of InputStream and is used to read bytes from a byte array.

6. ByteArrayOutputStream: This class is a subclass of OutputStream and is used to write bytes to a byte array.

Working with byte streams typically involves the following steps:

1. Opening the stream: Create an instance of the appropriate byte stream class based on whether you need to read from or write to a source or destination. Provide the necessary parameters, such as the file path or byte array, to specify the source or destination.

2. Reading or writing data: Use the methods provided by the byte stream class to read bytes from the source or write bytes to the destination. For example, `read()` is used to read a single byte, and `write()` is used to write a single byte.

3. Closing the stream: Once you have finished reading from or writing to the byte stream, it is important to close the stream to release any system resources associated with it. This is typically done by calling the `close()` method of the byte stream class.

Here's an example that demonstrates reading from a file using a `FileInputStream`:

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ByteStreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FileInputStream fis = null;
        try {
            // Open the input stream
            fis = new FileInputStream("input.txt");

            // Read bytes from the stream
            int byteRead;
            while ((byteRead = fis.read()) != -1) {
                // Process the byte
                System.out.print((char) byteRead);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            // Close the stream in the finally block to ensure it is always closed
            if (fis != null) {
                try {
                    fis.close();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `FileInputStream` is used to open the file "input.txt" and read bytes from it. The `read()` method is called in a loop until it returns -1, indicating the end of the file. Each byte read is cast to a `char` and printed to the console.

Remember to handle any potential exceptions that may occur while working with byte streams, and close the streams in a `finally` block to ensure proper resource management.
