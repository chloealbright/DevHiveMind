In programming, the term "runtime" refers to the period during which a program is executing or running on a computer. It encompasses the time from the start of a program to its termination. During the runtime, the program interacts with the underlying hardware and performs the tasks specified by its source code.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how the runtime of a program works:

1. **Program Initialization:**
   - When a program is executed, the operating system loads it into memory and starts its execution.
   - Initialization code is executed, which may include setting up variables, initializing data structures, and allocating necessary resources.

2. **Execution of Statements:**
   - The program's main logic, consisting of statements and expressions, is executed sequentially or based on control flow structures (e.g., loops, conditionals).
   - Each statement is translated into machine code or interpreted by a runtime environment.

3. **Memory Management:**
   - During runtime, the program allocates and deallocates memory as needed.
   - Memory management tasks include dynamic memory allocation, garbage collection (in languages with automatic memory management), and handling of memory leaks.

4. **Input/Output Operations:**
   - The program may interact with the user or external systems through input and output operations.
   - This involves reading from and writing to files, receiving input from the user, and communicating with external devices.

5. **Exception Handling:**
   - During execution, the program may encounter errors or exceptional conditions.
   - Exception handling mechanisms are responsible for managing these exceptional cases, allowing the program to gracefully recover or terminate with appropriate error messages.

6. **Concurrency and Multithreading (if applicable):**
   - In concurrent or multithreaded programs, multiple threads of execution may run simultaneously.
   - Runtime systems manage thread creation, synchronization, and communication to ensure proper coordination.

7. **Dynamic Dispatch (if applicable):**
   - In object-oriented programming, dynamic dispatch allows the program to invoke the appropriate method based on the runtime type of an object.
   - This enables polymorphism and late binding, enhancing flexibility in program design.

8. **Runtime Libraries and Services:**
   - Many programs rely on runtime libraries and services provided by the operating system or external libraries.
   - These libraries offer functions for tasks such as file handling, network communication, and system calls.

9. **Execution Termination:**
   - The program execution concludes either by reaching the end of the main routine or encountering an exit statement.
   - Resources are released, and control is returned to the operating system.

Understanding the runtime of a program is crucial for developers to optimize performance, manage resources efficiently, and handle various aspects of program execution. Different programming languages and environments may have unique runtime characteristics and features.
