TD Ameritrade - Business Systems Analyst 






TracFlo  

I worked at TracFlo as a full stack developer  which is a fintech company inside of the construction industry whose main goal is to eliminate change orders in construction projects by digitizing a lot of the documentation & process between all the parties in a construction project.  So I worked on multiple features on their new app. Like one of the initial things I worked on was the Data migration process between the old WordPress App & the new App. where I created different migration files using Knex.js(query builder) library for different data tables defined in the old app while redefining table relationships because they wanted to change some business logic. Besides that I worked on several endpoints using Typescript interfaces & types on an Express server & React on the Frontend using a combination of Redux, React hooks, & props & other libraries like MUI. I also worked on features like CreateTickets, & sub features like  Get all, Create, & Edit - equipment & materials. I defined Field definitions for user & labor. Created integration tests for endpoints using Mock Data. 

  

LESSONS 

Working on Get letter by  id endpoint  

Learning about all the changes that can happen on a codebase all at once which was overwhelming like typescript interfaces, new utils being added that need to be utilized & refactoring code. Learning to ask more question read code more efficiently. 

 identifying & visualizing codebase structure on whiteboard since no initial test.    

Observing where things can go wrong  like between integration test  & endpoint, Sql fixtures, or different Layers like Controller, data, model, routes, & service layer  

Reading errors on a large codebase & debugging in different parts of the codebase 

Working on being less prideful  

One of the reason I was like that was because I have high expectations of how I perform and where I want to be that I'm trying to learn as much as I can which can be detrimental a little bit and can lead to burning my brain out easy 

& it goes against the philosophy of software development which writing reusable efficient modular code. 

but  also reusing your brain and thinking more efficiently and not focusing too much on one problem when there are many problems 

not being worried about bothering others in the short term 

But I need to transition to asking myself more questions reducing stress to be more mentally clear which helps  

getting more curious and as I'm going through a code base just riding out more questions that I have so I can be more concise about what I'm trying to understand and ask 

You know when to sweat and know when to ask for help easily burn out your brain on one thing when there are many other things you might have to do and also time constraints if other devs' work are dependent on your work 

     

STATS 

=============================== 

Created endpoint 

--------------------------------------- 

Create Ticket 

No stats for old app 

Nothing to compare to 

Get all Ticket 

New app slower 808.00 ms might be implementation difference & doing things more securely  

Old app 576.12 ms 

  

Get letter by id (ask matt  about)  

if it is used anywhere probably doesn't exist yet since letter is collection of change Order & change order is a collection of tickets so change order isn't ready yet thus letters definitely not setup  

 ----------------------------------------------------------  

Connected to front-end & created endpoint 

--------------------------------------- 

Get all material & equipment 

4338.2ms new app 

8700.4ms old app 

Create materials & equipment 

321.542ms (89) new app took have the time 2x faster 

812.31 ms (98) old app pg load since PHP  

Edit materials & equipment didn't connect but did endpoint 

8222.9ms for material on frontend in new app 

Probably same for equipment since similiar 

------------------------------------------- 

  

================================ 

 Under the wing Independent contract project 

So I worked on a project for the department of a small business called Under the wing which is an online mentorship platform where I worked on the frontend  on a team, 3 Devs doing things like  defining scope of the project, deliverables, & defining data model . While practicing agile development. I worked with react, bootstrap & other libraries creating reusable components, while maintaining sprint cycles, and creating documentation with markdown  

 Dealing with dependency issues with npm and docker 

Park alert 

My most favorite project is park alert which is a is a mobile application that helps find parking spots. the inspiration for it was based on the citizen app meets uber. This project pushed me to really think & plan things out by creating many different UML diagrams mapping out the system design & it different parts. I also created a mock app using Dart, Flutter, & a map API. Creating all the diagrams help me develop my whiteboard and debugging code on a whiteboard. But overall I learned what it means to be a software developer because I had to learn a lot in that time period in terms of technology and understanding GitHub while also using Linux as my development environment and examining different projects to draw inspiration in terms of design.
