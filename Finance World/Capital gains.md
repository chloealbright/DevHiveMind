The capital gains clock does not reset when you continue to buy a stock. However, you can reset your cost basis higher by realizing capital gains. To take advantage of this, you can sell some investments with unrealized long term capital gains and immediately buy them back. There is no wash sale on realizing gains. Your cost basis will reset higher, which means you will pay less in taxes in the futureÂ¹.  
  
Sure! Let's say you have a toy that you bought for $10. After some time, the toy becomes very popular and its value increases to $20. If you sell the toy for $20, you will have made a profit of $10 ($20 - $10). This profit is called a capital gain.  
  
Now, let's say you want to buy the same toy again because you really like it. If you buy it for $20, the new cost of the toy is now $20. This new cost is called the cost basis. If the value of the toy increases to $30 and you sell it again, your capital gain will now be $10 ($30 - $20) instead of $20 ($30 - $10).
