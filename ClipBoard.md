Algorithmic patterns serve as reusable solutions to common problems encountered in algorithm design. These patterns encompass specific techniques or strategies that possess versatility in their application to various scenarios. Abstracted from specific implementations, these patterns offer a level of adaptability in solving diverse problems.

The interplay between algorithm patterns and abstractions lies in their capacity to conceptualize and generalize solutions. Abstractions play a crucial role in distilling the essence of a problem or solution, facilitating the application of a pattern across different contexts. Take the "sliding window" pattern, for instance, which abstracts the concept of maintaining a dynamic window of elements in a sequence, providing efficient solutions to problems like substring search or maximum subarray sum.

Algorithm patterns often carry visual names that succinctly describe the high-level strategy employed. For instance, the "sliding window" metaphor evokes the image of a window moving over a sequence of elements, highlighting a specific portion at a time. This visual representation aids in comprehending and remembering the fundamental approach when addressing problems aligned with this pattern. Other examples of visual names encompass "divide and conquer," "greedy algorithms," and "backtracking."

In summary, the synergy among algorithm patterns, abstractions, and visual names establishes a shared language and understanding among algorithm designers. This shared understanding streamlines communication and facilitates the application of effective solutions to a broad spectrum of problems.
