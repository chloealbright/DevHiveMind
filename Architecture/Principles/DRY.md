In programming, "dry" stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself." It's a principle that encourages developers to avoid duplicating code. Instead, they should strive to use abstractions, functions, or modules to reduce redundancy. The goal is to have a single, authoritative source for a particular piece of knowledge or logic, making the code more maintainable and less error-prone. Following the DRY principle helps improve code readability and facilitates easier updates in the future.
