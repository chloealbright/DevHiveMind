CV  

As a software developer, I know that there are many levels of software development, and I know I’m the best candidate for the role because of my mindset. Which has helped me conquer many obstacles and continue to find the different missing pieces of the puzzle we call software development. I learned a long time ago that everything is hard, but once I get familiar with the problem and become obsessed and immersed. I can confront the unknown and continue to plot forward and tackle the problem. I view software development as high-level problem solving and consider it similar to martial arts because both are disciplines that require discipline. There is a certain level of attention to detail that you need to maintain while being disciplined and learning many skill sets while applying them, and being alert, sharp to avoid punches while trying to hit back or take someone down and in software development, you have to be almost all those things and willing to learn more. And I believe I carry these attributes because I always try to be better by lapping my past self in a race full of obstacles and problems to be solved.

As a software developer, I know that there are many levels to software development, and I know I am the best candidate for the role because of my mindset. Which has helped me conquer many obstacles and continue to find the different missing pieces of the puzzle we call software development. I learned a long time ago that everything is hard, but once I get familiar with the problem and become obsessed and immersed, I can confront the unknown and continue to plot forward towards the problem. Over the years, I have worked with many technologies and am most familiar with JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap creating self-containing, reusable, and testable components. As for the back-end I have worked with technologies like Express.js, Node, PostgreSQL, and Docker while applying MVC design patterns for separation of concerns and business-logic-containment, increasing back-end performance, development, iteration, and debugging efficiency by 20%. I have also worked with OOP & Data Structures & Algorithms Using Java and JavaScript. I’ve also worked with GitHub, RESTful APIs, and asynchronous programming.
