# Tips

If you get a high-end CPU and GPU should probably go to 64 gigs of RAM  
  
Get a high-end CPU if you plan to have it for five to six years without changing it and just upgrading your graphics card  
  
Installing games on a separate SSD that doesn't have your OS on it makes it perform faster for games  
  
M.2 slots on desktop  
  
For the first slot at the top, the two SATA ports at the top will be disabled  
  
As for the second slot, it will be disabled if you are using PCIe slots below the graphics card  
  
Also, the m.2 on the top is better so I can use that for Windows and the other for Linux
