Good morning I'm currently facing some challenges with my TypeScript project  and wanted to know if anyone has encountered this issue the project is fairly simple I,m basically exporting a whole bunch of coding challenge functions and creating test but cant get my main file to run.

I've encountered two errors, and I'm wondering if anyone has run into similar issues or can provide guidance on troubleshooting. Here are the errors:

1. **TypeError [ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION]:**
    
    - Unknown file extension ".ts" for `/home/jac/Music/DevReps/src/app.ts`
2. **Error [ERR_UNSUPPORTED_DIR_IMPORT]:**
    
    - Directory import '/home/jac/Music/DevReps/build/src/Solution/_Extra Challenges' is not supported resolving ES modules imported from `/home/jac/Music/DevReps/build/src/app.js`

My Node.js version is v20.9.0.

If anyone has insights into what might be causing these errors or suggestions for checking my `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, or `babel.config.json` , I would greatly appreciate your help.

Thank you in advance!
