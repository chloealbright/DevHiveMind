As a technology user, I generally avoid heavy use of social media, but I do utilize it to stay connected with family. My primary engagement, however, is on YouTube, where I've created playlists and implemented a subscription manager to control my video feed and limit my consumption. I've even dedicated a separate account solely for software development-related content.

My experience with YouTube highlights the need for ethical considerations in UX and technology overall. Platforms often experiment with features that can significantly impact user behavior. For instance, YouTube once had a feature allowing users to organize subscriptions into folders, reducing the feed's content. However, this feature was later removed, potentially to increase site engagement.

While I'm conscious of my content choices and prioritize meaningful consumption, I recognize the psychological aspects at play, such as the satisfaction of completing a playlist. This awareness emphasizes the importance of incorporating ethical practices into technology design, aligning with the sentiments expressed in the article.
