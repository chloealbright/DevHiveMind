## When cake is ordered

using cake reducer cake count is decremented by one and the ice cream reducer responds to the same action since they both have cake_ordered action in there reducer so ice cream is decremented


each reducer can update only its portion of app state but with they share the same action type that gets dispatch then they both will apply the action in the state


but in redux toolkit this isnt the case and that is where extra reducers comes in
  

by default reducers from one create slice will only respond to the action types generated in that slice and not other slices

  
another way of looking at it is reducers from one create slice will only respond to action type generated by that current slice

  
there are two ways to implement

  

```javascript
const { cakeActions } = require('../cake/cakeSlice')

const createSlice = require('@reduxjs/toolkit').createSlice

  
const initialState = {

numOfIcecreams: 10

}


const icecreamSlice = createSlice({

name: 'icecream',

initialState,

reducers: {

ordered: state => {

state.numOfIcecreams--

},

restocked: (state, action) => {

state.numOfIcecreams += action.payload

}

},

// first way

extraReducers: builder => {

	builder.addCase(cakeActions.ordered, state => {

	state.numOfIcecreams--

	})

}

// second way

// extraReducers: {

// ['cake/ordered']: state => {

// state.numOfIcecreams--

// }

// }

})

  

module.exports = icecreamSlice.reducer

module.exports.icecreamActions = icecreamSlice.actions
```
