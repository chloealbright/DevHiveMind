 Enums in Java are used to define a fixed set of constants. An enum type is a special type of class that represents a group of related constants. Enums provide a way to create a collection of predefined values that can be used as options or choices in your program.


```java
enum LicenseType {
    CAR,
    MOTORCYCLE,
    TRUCK
}
```



Certainly! Let's update the fields in the `@LicenseInfo` annotation to something more meaningful for the context of a driving school. We can change the fields to `category` and `issuedBy`, which represent the license category and the authority that issued the license, respectively.

Annotations: Annotations in Java provide a way to add metadata or extra information to your code. They can be applied to classes, methods, variables, and other program elements. Annotations do not define constants like enums; instead, they are used to provide additional information or instructions to the compiler, runtime, or other tools.

```java
@interface LicenseInfo {
    String category();
    String issuedBy();
}
```

Now, we can apply the updated `@LicenseInfo` annotation to each enum constant in the `LicenseType` enum, providing specific information about the license category and the authority that issued the license.

```java
@LicenseInfo(category = "Car License", issuedBy = "Department of Motor Vehicles")
CAR,

@LicenseInfo(category = "Motorcycle License", issuedBy = "Department of Motor Vehicles")
MOTORCYCLE,

@LicenseInfo(category = "Truck License", issuedBy = "Department of Transportation")
TRUCK
```

In this example, the `category` field represents the type of license, such as a car license, motorcycle license, or truck license. The `issuedBy` field represents the authority responsible for issuing the license, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles or the Department of Transportation.

Feel free to adapt these fields to match the specific categories and issuing authorities relevant to your driving school scenario.
