C is more performant compared to other languages because it is closer to the lower level language which are very perform-ant but can be harder to read unlike python and other high level languages 

C if a functional language without classes but still has object used to create Operating system

Learn how data is represented in a computer, the basics of digital logic design, Boolean algebra, computer arithmetic, floating-point representation, cache design. Try and learn a little about C and Assembly programming. 



There have been many discussions about this. Mainly, the reason is a philosophical one. C was invented as a simple language for system development (not so much application development). There are many arguments for using C++, but there are about as many for not using C++ and sticking to C. 

In the end, it's a historical issue. Most application stuff is written in C, because most Kernel stuff is written in C. And since back then most stuff was written in C, people tend to use the original languages. 

At this point, someone might ask "OK, so why is the kernel written in C and not ported to C++?". This has been discussed on kerneltrap some time ago. One nice explanation that can be quoted from this thread is a response 

C 

The linux kernel is written in the C programming language
