In Jira, user stories are a common way of expressing product features or functionalities from an end user's perspective. They help agile teams prioritize and deliver value incrementally. In Jira, user stories are typically created and managed within the context of an Agile board, which is associated with a specific project. 

**You have to create blank stories to show available capacity ðŸ˜†**

Here are some common types of user stories in Jira:

1. **Standard User Stories:**
   - These are the typical user stories representing a single piece of functionality or a feature from the user's perspective.
   - Example: "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [benefit]."

2. **Epic:**
   - An epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into smaller user stories.
   - It represents a broader feature or a set of related features.
   - Epics are often used for high-level planning and breaking down large tasks into more manageable pieces.

3. **Sub-Task:**
   - Sub-tasks are used to break down user stories into smaller, more detailed tasks.
   - They represent the individual steps or components required to complete a user story.
   - Sub-tasks are managed within the context of a parent user story.

4. **BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) User Stories:**
   - These user stories are often written using a Given-When-Then format to describe the behavior of the system.
   - Example: "Given [some initial context], When [an action is performed], Then [the expected outcome should be]."
   - Tools like Cucumber or Behave may be integrated for BDD scenarios.

5. **Non-functional Requirements/User Stories:**
   - These user stories focus on non-functional aspects such as performance, security, or usability.
   - Example: "As a user, I want the application to load within 2 seconds for a better user experience."

6. **Spike(Proof of Concept):**
   - A spike is a user story that is created to explore and gather more information about a certain aspect of the project.
   - It's often used when there is uncertainty or a need for research before estimating and committing to the work.

>Clone and close stories if work continues into next sprint and just in general just quicker to create new stories; if no work has been done, move them forward to next sprint.


In Jira, these user story types are managed and visualized on Agile boards, where teams can plan, track progress, and collaborate on delivering value in an iterative and incremental manner. The specific types and terminology may vary based on the customization and configuration of your Jira instance and the agile methodology your team follows.

### **Conducting Effective Conversations for Requirements Gathering:**

As a Business Systems Analyst (BSA), engaging in purposeful conversations is critical. Ensure a structured approach by adhering to the following sequence:

1. **Ask Questions in this Order:**
   - **What(broadest question of them all):** Identify different scenarios and dependencies.
   - **Why:** Uncover the root causes at various scopes, using creative and indirect queries.
	   - Other way of asking whyÂ Â 
		   - Can you tell me what's leading you to this requestÂ Â 
		   - Do you have any perspective on where... 
		   - Is there any reason this wouldn't have...Â Â Â 
	   - Instead of asking why directly which can offend or make people feel type away you can be creative as the top example showsÂ Â 
	   - Then you can actually ask why for the question you want to ask so you basically kind of want to build up to the why while still asking why in the above examplesÂ 
   - **Which:** Pinpoint specific points or compare options.
   - **How:** Identify the necessary steps.
   - **When:** Determine the timeline.
   - **Where:** Identify the location.

   Start with open-ended questions, transitioning to closed-ended ones for specific information and decisive responses.

2. **Privacy Considerations:**
   - Safeguard private information, especially when formulating plans.
   - Be aware of the organizational culture and people's temperament.
   - Assess how the work may impact stakeholders, identifying supporters and non-supporters.

### **Translating Business Needs to Technical Requirements:**

#### **Identify and Consider:**
   - Organization position and its impact on structure.
   - Priority of needs and wants.
   - Applicability of requirements, justifying their value, complexity, cost, and legal aspects.
   - External constraints, geopolitical factors, regulations, and legal considerations.
   - Business as usual (BAU) operations.
   - Alternative actions, potential risks, and hurdles.

#### **Potential Responsibilities:**
   - Assist testing teams in translating requirements into test conditions.
   - Contribute to project management activities, scoping, estimating, and risk identification.
   - Participate in quality management reviews, collaborating with vendors on business case development.

#### **Certifications for BSA:**
   - PMI, PBA, CBAP.

### **Functional and Non-Functional Requirements:**
   - Functional requirements describe how the system must work.
   - Non-functional requirements specify how the system should perform.

### **Key Responsibilities of a BSA:**
   - User support, case resolution, system enhancement identification.
   - Leverage Salesforce.com for evolving business requirements.
   - Develop project deliverables, solution design, and system configuration.
   - Collaborate with teams for issue resolution, upgrades, and releases.
   - Lead efforts to optimize Salesforce.com usage and user competency.

### **Understanding Stakeholder Needs:**

#### **Needs + Wants + Data = Business Requirements:**
   - Business needs arise from factors like customer complaints, market changes, and process inefficiencies.
   - Stakeholder incentives, influences, and motivations should be identified, categorized, and prioritized.
   - Consider the scope, organizational culture, and established information when determining user wants.
   - Assess data relevance, quality, volume, availability, and accessibility.

### **Assumptions and Constraints:**
   - **Assumptions:** Identify, document, confirm accuracy, and manage risks associated with unproven factors.
   - **Constraints:** Recognize impositions or restrictions on the project, including business, technical, and external constraints.
   - **Triple Constraint:** Consider the interplay of budget, time, and scope in project management.
