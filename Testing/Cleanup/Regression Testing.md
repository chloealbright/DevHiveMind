![[Regression test.gif]]

Regression testing is testing existing software applications to make sure that a change or addition hasnâ€™t broken any existing functionality. Its purpose is to catch bugs that may have been accidentally introduced into a new build or release candidate, and to ensure that previously eradicated bugs continue to stay dead.
