## Steps to Create LLC:

Choose a name for your LLC. It should be unique and distinguishable from other businesses. You may need to check with your state to see if the name is available and complies with any naming guidelines.  
  
File articles of organization with your state government. This document establishes your LLC as a separate legal entity and outlines the basic information about your business, such as its name, purpose, and the names of the members (owners).  
  
Create an operating agreement. This document outlines the rules and regulations for your LLC, including how the business will be managed, how profits and losses will be shared, and the rights and responsibilities of the members.  
  
Obtain any necessary licenses and permits. Depending on the type of business you are starting and where you are located, you may need to obtain various licenses and permits to operate legally.  
  
Register for state taxes. LLCs are required to pay taxes at the state and federal level. You will need to register for state taxes, including sales tax and any other applicable taxes, in order to operate legally.  
  
Register for employment taxes. If you will have employees, you will need to register for employment taxes, including unemployment insurance and workers' compensation insurance.  
  
Obtain any necessary insurance. Depending on the type of business you are starting, you may need to obtain various types of insurance, such as liability insurance, to protect your business and its assets.  
  
It is a good idea to seek the advice of a lawyer or accountant when setting up your LLC, as the specific requirements may vary depending on your state and the nature of your business.

## LLC Series Trust Formation

In order to structure trust with a Limited Liability Company (LLC), you may want to consider forming what is known as a "Series LLC."  
  
A Series LLC is a type of LLC that allows you to create multiple "series" within the LLC, which are essentially separate sub-entities. Each series can have its own assets, liabilities, and members, and can be managed independently from the other series.  
  
To create a Series LLC, you will need to follow the standard procedures for forming an LLC in your state, but with the additional step of including language in the LLC's operating agreement that establishes the creation of series.  
  
Once the Series LLC is established, you can create a trust and designate the Series LLC as the trust's owner. This can provide added asset protection and liability protection for the trust, as the assets held within the Series LLC's various series are legally separate from one another.  
  
It is important to note that not all states allow for the formation of Series LLCs, so you should consult with a qualified attorney in your state to ensure that this is a viable option for you. Additionally, creating and managing a Series LLC can be more complex and costly than a standard LLC, so you should weigh the benefits and drawbacks before deciding whether this is the right structure for your trust.


## Can you create a series LLC in New York

Yes, New York State does allow for the creation of Series LLCs. The New York Limited Liability Company Law (NY LLCL) allows for the formation of a Series LLC and provides guidelines for its operation.  
  
To create a Series LLC in New York, you will need to follow the standard procedures for forming an LLC in the state, including filing Articles of Organization with the New York Department of State and preparing an operating agreement. The operating agreement should include language establishing the creation of series, and each series should be designated with a unique name or identifier.  
  
It is important to note that while New York State does allow for Series LLCs, they are a relatively new legal entity and may not be recognized or fully understood in all states or jurisdictions. This can create legal complications if you do business in other states. Therefore, it is recommended that you consult with a qualified attorney to ensure that a Series LLC is the right legal structure for your business and that it is set up properly in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
