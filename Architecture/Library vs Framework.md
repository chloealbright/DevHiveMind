Developers often use the terms “library” and “framework” interchangeably. But there is a difference. 

Both frameworks and libraries are code written by someone else that is used to help solve common problems. 

A library is like going to Ikea. You already have a home, but you need a bit of help with furniture. You don’t feel like making your own table from scratch. Ikea allows you to pick and choose different things to go in your home. You are in control. 

A framework, on the other hand, is like building a model home. You have a set of blueprints and a few limited choices when it comes to architecture and design. Ultimately, the contractor and blueprint are in control. And they will let you know when and where you can provide your input.

The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called inversion of control. 

When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed. 

Let’s look at an example using jQuery (a library) and Vue.js (a framework). 

Imagine we want to display an error message when an error is present. In our example, we will click a button, and pretend an error occurs.



A library is more lightweight and can be used in any part of the code base  

A framework is more heavy and involved and focuses on all of the things like front end and back end workflow stuff where react is more specific to just the front end
