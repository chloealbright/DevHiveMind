Disposability: **The twelve-factor app’s processes are  _disposable_, meaning they can be started or stopped at a moment’s notice.** This facilitates fast elastic scaling, rapid deployment of code or config changes, and robustness of production deploys. Docker containers align with this factor very strongly especially when you have proper [[Process Isolation]] in your codebase disposibility is enhanced. If a container fails or needs to be replaced, it can be easily terminated and a new one can take its place, ensuring the overall system's availability and resilience.
