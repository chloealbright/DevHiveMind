Map  
A collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique and used to retrieve the associated value.  

Associative Array  
An abstract data type that stores key-value pairs, allowing for efficient retrieval based on the key.  
May be implemented as a hash map, hash table, or other data structures.  
  
Hash Table  
A data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to indices in an array, allowing for constant time retrieval.  
May use collision resolution techniques such as chaining or open addressing.  
  
 
  
Dictionary  
A higher-level abstraction of a hash map in some programming languages, allowing for easy access and manipulation of key-value pairs.  
  
TreeMap  
A tree-based data structure that stores key-value pairs in a sorted order based on the keys.  
Provides efficient operations for finding the minimum and maximum keys, and for finding all keys within a given range.  
  
LinkedHashMap  
A hash table that maintains the order of key-value pairs based on their insertion order.  
Allows for efficient retrieval based on the keys, while also preserving the order in which the elements were added.  
  
WeakHashMap  
A hash map where the keys are held weakly, allowing them to be garbage collected if they are no longer referenced elsewhere in the program.  
Useful for implementing caching or other memory-sensitive applications.


HashMap/hash table 

Hash Table (this is really important - understand all of the different collision mitigation mechanisms, understand what amortized constant-time means) 

Linked Hash Map (this is very specific, but comes up a LOT in interviews)




Hash tables, hash maps, and dictionaries are all data structures used to store and retrieve data based on a key. While they share some similarities, there are also some differences between them.  
  
A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to indices in an array. The indices are then used to store the associated values. Hash tables can be implemented with various collision resolution strategies, including chaining and open addressing.  
  
A hash map is a specific type of hash table that typically uses chaining to handle collisions. In a hash map, each index in the underlying array typically contains a linked list of key-value pairs, and new pairs are added to the appropriate list when collisions occur.  
  
A dictionary is a term that is often used interchangeably with a hash map. In many programming languages, including Python and Java, dictionaries are implemented as hash maps. In this context, a dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique and used to retrieve the associated value.  
  
In summary, hash tables and hash maps are similar data structures that use a hash function to map keys to indices in an array. Hash maps are a specific type of hash table that typically uses chaining to handle collisions. Dictionaries are often used as a higher-level abstraction of hash maps in programming languages.






  
  
  
Hash maps and hash tables are very similar data structures and are often used interchangeably, but they are not exactly the same.  
  
In general, a hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to indices in an array. The indices are then used to store the associated values. The term "hash table" is often used in a more general sense to refer to any implementation of this data structure, regardless of the specific implementation details.  
  
On the other hand, a hash map is a specific implementation of a hash table that typically uses a combination of hashing and chaining to handle collisions (i.e., situations where multiple keys map to the same index). In a hash map, each index in the underlying array typically contains a linked list of key-value pairs, and new pairs are added to the appropriate list when collisions occur.  
  
So, while both data structures use hashing to store and retrieve data, the term "hash map" typically refers to a specific implementation of a hash table that uses chaining to handle collisions, whereas the term "hash table" can refer to a more general concept of a data structure that uses hashing.
