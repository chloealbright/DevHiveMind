As simple as it may sound, just ask the HR manager the size of the stock option plan that was issued. Normally, the manager should tell you whether the pool was 3% or 10%.  
  
Once you have asked the size of the plan, ask the same manager what your collaborators at similar levels have received. Be subtle, don’t sound jealous, just ask for fairness. I would expect HR to give you the real number since the one-year cliff gives the company a lot of protection.  
  
Finally, ask around. Talk to a friend in another startup, in another VC, on Reddit (r/Entrepreneurship — has no posting restrictions if you don’t have any karma), or ask me (I answer every single message I receive, in due time).  
Adapt your expectation accordingly from the informations you have gathered and give your equity number. Expect a negotiation downward therefore layer in some margin/cushion to your number.


if the company has above 2 million in funding on Crunchbase that is pretty good
