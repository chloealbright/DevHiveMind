Comments are basically another form of documentation that has to be maintained so you have to do it smarter and make you a code speak for itself in terms of the convention 

Use verbs in your method and function names making them descriptive 

Remove commented-out code for production application 

Avoid todo,s 

Make short one-line comments to label important legal stuff and stuff that really need an explanation like a regular expression  

And comment if there is an issue with a line of code
