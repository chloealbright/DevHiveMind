User stories and coding challenges share the commonality of presenting problems to solve, but they differ in scope and context. A coding challenge is often a specific, isolated problem requiring a technical solution. It's a puzzle to be solved within the constraints of a given prompt. In contrast, a user story is broader, typically framed within the context of business requirements, often expressed through OKRs (Objectives and Key Results). User stories involve understanding the needs of end-users and can evolve with changing business priorities.

While a coding challenge focuses on technical problem-solving skills, user stories demand a more comprehensive approach, incorporating communication with stakeholders, adapting to evolving requirements, and considering the broader impact on the user experience. Both, however, serve as valuable exercises for developers, honing different aspects of their skills.
