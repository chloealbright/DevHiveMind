Used a lot more but should try to use for worst-case

![[unnamed (15).gif]]

Merge sort is a sorting technique based on the divide and conquer technique. With worst-case time complexity being ÎŸ(n log n), it is one of the most respected algorithms.  
  
O(n) for space complexity  
  
So if you're worried about worst-case scenarios you should use Merge sort.  
  
But if you want to sort in memory on your machine and you're worried about space complexity merge sort  
  
is going to be really expensive a userspace complexity of all of that.  
  
However, if he had huge files that can be sorted in memory so you have external sorting that you need  
  
maybe like a process outside of memory it's suitable for external sorting then merge sort is good because we won't care as much about space complexity
