Negotiating your salary effectively requires a strategic approach. Consider the following steps:

1. **Take a Negotiation Class:**
   Enhance your negotiation skills by taking a class. Specify your salary range between $91,000 and $130,000.

2. **Let the Company Lead:**
   Allow the company to share information first. Minimum salary expectations: $5,000 to $9,500 per month or $31 to $60 per hour.

3. **Survivability and Four-Year Plan:**
   Assess if the offer aligns with your living expenses. Consider the four-year vesting schedule for equity. If relevant, mention family needs for a certain base pay.

4. **Research and Range:**
   Research industry averages and company specifics. Propose a range, such as $91,000 to $105,000, aiming for 10-15% more than the initial offer.

5. **Financial Sense and Stock Options:**
   Calculate comparative values of packages. Inquire about stock purchase opportunities. Negotiate from a lower salary with an opportunity for quicker renegotiation.

6. **Dealing with Recruiters:**
   If dealing with a recruiter, inquire about the role's budget. Politely address salary discussions, stating your preferred range but try to get them to disclose there range first.

7. **Handling Multiple Offers:**
   Create urgency with other companies. Communicate the offer received and express excitement about the potential to work with their company.

8. **Excuses in Negotiations:**
   Use excuses to justify a higher salary based on the value you provide and potential time constraints.

9. **Raises and Long-Term Growth:**
   Plan your career path, be a valuable employee, and negotiate for future raises. Consider long-term growth, company culture, and benefits.

10. **Best Books on Negotiation:**
    Explore books like "Getting More," "Crucial Conversations," "Influence," "Bargaining for Advantage," "Getting to Yes," and "Never Split the Difference" for negotiation insights.

11. **Benefits and Questions:**
    Ask about learning opportunities, company culture, perks, and other benefits. Inquire about title, workdays off, and more.

12. **Handling Haggling and Concessions:**
    Manage concessions strategically, avoid haggling on multiple issues, and be clear in your communication. Reframe ultimatums and seek creative solutions.

Remember, negotiating is an art that involves preparation, clear communication, and strategic thinking.
