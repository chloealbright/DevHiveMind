Ask questions about things you already know or obvious to you to see what advice someone gives you and what their intentions are


## Cold call
- Cold call the company to ask him about the schedule interview that is not actually there to get an interview

## Looking busy
- Elongate statistics so if you're talking about doing something for a year instead of saying 1 year say over 12 months



Introduce yourself with your role and department 



No performance reviews for contractors  

Schedule meeting with your boss's boss asking them to get information on something and learn more just to get familiarize with something and also to get them from other as a few and seeing irreplaceable and showing initiative  

You can ask her feedback on something that they are specifically invested in that you wanted to know more about  

thank the person for there time and information then tell them I'll let you know how it goes would it be possible to me if you for 30 minutes like in a month or two to show you where I'm at... Etc  

If if interviewing for another company and you tell them that you were laid off CC or previous manager who you have foster the relationship with to loop them in and they can provide positive feedback to the new hiring manager of the company you trying to interview with   

You can also get copies of your performance reviews save them so you can use them as references for future hiring managers to look at
