But how do you start the chain?  
  
Chances are, you already have contacts in the tech industry. Even if you think you don’t, you probably do. Go scour your LinkedIn, your Facebook, ask your family, talk to people you kinda knew in high school. Nothing is off-limits.  
  
Make a spreadsheet of every single person you know who works for a tech company. Markdown what company they work for, and what their role is at that company.  
  
Then sort all of your contacts by company, and then by role. You should reach out to your most relevant contact at every single company on your list (an engineer is more relevant than someone in operations, etc).  
  
Reach out to every single one.  
  
Invite them to coffee, lunch, dinner, whatever. Always buy. Farm them for referrals and further contacts. If you have a strong network, this is likely to be the most powerful source of leads for you.  
  
This is great because unless you have a stellar resume (which I assume you don’t because you’re bothering to read this guide), referrals are going to be an order of magnitude more impactful than raw applications. This is especially true at top companies.  
  
So keep your funnel healthy. Keep scheduling coffee dates. Keep networking, even if you’re mid-way through your job search. I didn’t stop meeting with people until I had about 4 offers, and even then I still reached out to people at new companies I was interested in.  
  
  
  
  
Speaking, Conversation, & Mental Dialogue  
================================  
  
The reason we hate public speaking is because of Epigenetics we associate public speaking with the feeling of having to defend our self's in front of people like when you are being accused of something like being called a witch in the Salem trials or a murder in court  
  
Improving conversation Skills Get in to conversation with out asking yes or no question  
  
Talk to people with the motive of using them.  
  
Speaking is like driving in traffic sometimes you get into a wreck getting in an argument or you cut off someone by accident so slow down and process the information  
  
  
Mental Dialogue  
  
Be a master of mind not a victim of thought  
  
Create people in your head who doubt your ability and get angry and show them who is right, prove your existence by proving them wrong  
  
Conversation  
  
Being present  
  
Don't rant about a topic  
  
Open ended question who, when, why  
  
Go with the flow  
  
Admit not knowing something  
  
Don't equate your experience to others  
  
Don't repeat self  
  
Forget about the extra details  
  
Listen  
  
Be brief  
  
=EDIT======================  
  
jokes  
---------  
Doing pause and play jokes during asynchronous coding with await and aync and explaining it in a funny example

### Decoding Evasive Interview Practices

#### Understanding Role Availability

1. **Positive Atmosphere:**
   - Engaging technical discussions set a positive tone in the interview.
   - Theoretical exploration without a coding test allows for a comprehensive assessment.

2. **Critical Questioning:**
   - When asked about specific questions regarding the role, the atmosphere shifts.
   - The candidate's interest in understanding the role's background becomes crucial.

3. **Red Flags of Evasion:**
   - Evasiveness or reluctance in sharing insights into role availability raises concerns.
   - Transparency is crucial unless the position involves top-secret information.

4. **Role Realities:**
   - Transparent discussions about the role's origin align expectations with reality.
   - Cautionary tales include companies concealing maintenance-heavy positions.

#### Beware of Bait and Switch Tactics

1. **Initial Tech Enthusiasm:**
   - The allure of advertised technologies attracts candidates.
   - Swift transitions to unrelated tasks may deviate from the promised tech landscape.

2. **Persistent Diversions:**
   - Temporary detours can evolve into persistent shifts away from preferred technologies.
   - Vigilance is essential to prevent unexpected and challenging tech scenarios.

3. **Evasiveness on Technologies:**
   - Interviewer evasiveness about technologies may indicate a lack of commitment.
   - Ambiguous references to evaluations or rewrites can lead to unanticipated work environments.

4. **Commitment from Both Sides:**
   - Successful work relationships require commitment from both employer and candidate.
   - Clarifying expectations ensures alignment between advertised roles and actual responsibilities.

#### Conveyor Belt Interview Trap

1. **Swift Questioning Approach:**
   - The conveyor belt approach involves swift, question-heavy interviews.
   - Candidates might feel processed rather than engaged, signaling potential issues.

2. **Warning Signs:**
   - Rapid interviews may indicate high turnover, company expansion, or a mass exodus.
   - Due diligence involves investigating employee numbers and market perceptions.

3. **Contractor Consideration:**
   - Contractors may endure faster-paced interviews, but even startups should allow candidate inquiries.
   - Tempting financial offers should not overshadow the importance of asking questions.

4. **Informed Decision-Making:**
   - The ability to inquire during interviews is crucial for making informed career decisions.
   - Candidates should not compromise on the opportunity to understand the work environment.
