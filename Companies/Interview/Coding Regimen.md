Identify problem area and what level your on 

Study problem area (google/youtube/books/peer discussion etc.) 

In general, you can revisit grokking pattern question even if you didn't code it out just focus on coding out problems in general to breakdown and understand and whiteboard for those that are too difficult but code more than whiteboarding solutions 

Test (questions from LeetCode etc.) 

Study solutions of tested questions (important!!!) 

Re-evaluate and reflect (identify successes and problem areas) 

Retest (same questions from #3) 

Building logic in general just going over coding problems 

Improving on recursive logic and combining recursive with iterative logic 

read problems and break them down to understand don't solve 

Do code challenges passively while exploring technologies working on other skill sets learning new things then when you schedule an interview code more and switch to more of a leetcode & pair programming regimen 

Run through a range of problems with arrays, matrix, string, and integer manipulation first reading questions breaking them down within 10 to 15 minutes to really grasp the problem then rinse and repeat with other questions without coding Then actually attempt the problem step by step and mentally debug working out a rough brute/naive approach  

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Work on string array and object questions going through them doing a brute Force imperative approach </mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Then go over those questions again but this time a brute Force declarative approach </mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">You can maybe utilize other data structures in approach for this brute Force section or after when you start trying to do it with a naive or optimal approach </mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">After that </mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Go over the questions again this time doing a naive or optimal approach that is imperative or declarative depending on what the question is </mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Then move on to more advanced data structure questions </mark>





## Revisit 

problems a second time and come up with an approach that includes a helper or built-in function and a data structure outside of Linked-list, trees, or graphs and it doesn't have to be optimal 

Third time go for an optimal approach think about applying algo pattern like two pointer etc .... 

Coding Challenges in general algoExpert mental debug accessing problem 





## Repeat 

Most examples are too small or are special cases. Debug your example. Is there any way it's a special case? Is it big enough?  avoid special cases  

Test your code-on paper. This means testing the general cases, base cases, error cases, and so on. You'll need to do this during your interview, so it's best to practice this in advance.  

Type your paper code as-is into a computer. You will probably make a bunch of mistakes. Start a list of all the errors you make so that you can keep these in mind during the actual interview.  

follow with BUD(Bottlenecks Unnecessary Duplicated work) optimization technique to reduce and eliminate things  

Make a time vs. space tradeoff. Hash tables are especially useful!   

Use a fresh example. Sometimes, just seeing a different example will unclog your mind or help you see a pattern in the problem.







So study one topic for two days or more then switch to another topic for the same amount of time or more than a third topic with for a week all the topic would be topics under level 1 which is research and one question at the end 

then later in the day or next week switch to another topic but on level two were you are doing questions(CURRENTLY ON LEVEL TWO FOR A GOOD PERCENT OF TOPICS) 

then alternate to level 3 were your just focused on question covering different topic about 3 topics max or 2 min



Closure methods naming convention the outer function should include something like a gate in the name and the inner function should be something with the name of the door
