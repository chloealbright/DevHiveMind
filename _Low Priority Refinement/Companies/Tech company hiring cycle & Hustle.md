# Saying no  



If asked early in the process about compensation tell them that honestly I've been preparing for the interview so I haven't given a lot of thought could you kind of walk over the compensation structure and some of the perks and benefits so I can get a better idea of things  

Negotiation can start on the first call depending how far you are in the interview process always ask What is the next step in the hiring process? When can I expect to hear back from you? What is your timeline for filling this role ? if they give you a time frame and don't respond contact them  

Think about the math of your number like estimate or look for how many employees they have and come up with a general salary for them and add that all together to see how much it totals and try to get your number to around the range if that's what you're looking for in that range  

Provide timeline on other offers and interviews To give an expectation if they give you less time ask them when do you need an answer if you have other offers your wafting on tell them it is too short can we meet in the middle and i give you an answer at this time because I you don't want to turn down other opportunities without understanding what's in front of me  

So With that in mind Do you think we can be more flexible with the time and find something a little more longer I can try to talk to the other companies to see if I can expedite things a little more quicker 

Also don't forget to reinforce multiple times that you are interested to work at the company

Tell the company that you appreciate the offer and meeting them and that you consider your top choices however I'm speaking with other companies and make a decision I can commit to in order to make the right decision for me and my family and myself at this point in my career So I need some time to assess things but I'll keep you in the loop  

Do this on the phone  

Also the bigger the company the more time you might have on the timeline  

If they tell you that they have multiple candidates ask them how many positions they're looking to fill get as much info  

When it comes to them asking you your number again tell them that you're not comfortable with giving out that information nothing is finalized and say you understand my expectations that you laid out before at the beginning of the negotiation and say I just want to see what we can do  


And reiterate your range You mentioned if they tried to get you down again  

When it comes to leveraging numbers of other companies against each other  

Tell them let's see what we could do I'm flexible on the right offer  

I'm happy to be more transparent when things are more finalized from the other companies  


Avoid situations where you're waiting on numbers from other companies where is this giant loop of companies waiting on each other's numbers tell them that you've been in the situation before where this has been the case and I'm very interested in the value you see me and so um I want to see what you produce and once we have that and I'm happy to have a deeper conversation otherwise if not if you're not willing to give numbers till we get other numbers then I don't know if this is going to work  

Lead with carrot not stick meaning for example if you're talking with the company you could say I'm willing to start today or whenever if we could get to this number by the end of the day almost have a car salesman but you better be prepared to follow up if you do something like this  

Let the company know that you are close to coming to a agreement with them we just need to do a and b and we do right there we're very close using the word close is important because it creates a psychological need to get there without being too pushy or urgent  

Never tell a company that you got accepted or declined from a other company during negotiations or that couldn't come to an agreement  

Never lie about other numbers they might ask for proof  

When you can't get to the number dial back to a slightly lower number
