![[Structured vs Unstructured DB.png]]

Talk about database like the data being organized so you might need a SQL database  
  
or  
  
talk about the data being unstructured so you'll need a NoSQL  
  
The main difference between unstructured data and structured data is that structured data is typically used for general stuff and it's very organized like user accounts and the information associated with that as for unstructured is typically did I like media audio, geo-location, and weather  
  
Besides that, you want the other servers for database application you would want a master that handles the crud(Create Read Update Delete) processes and the copies would handle the reading operation you'll probably have more slaves databases and proportion to master the reason we want this because it allows queries to be processed in parallel Which is good for performance
