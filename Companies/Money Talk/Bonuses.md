When asking about bonuses politely ask about the possibility of bonuses. Subsequently, express that while the base pay is not within your expected range, you believe a well-structured bonus could be impactful. 

## Potential Factors 
Bonuses are typically paid semi-annually and are influenced by several factors:

**1. Level of Seniority:** This factor involves a multiplier of the base salary, which increases as employees progress in their careers.

**2. Individual Performance:** Individual performance is assessed using a multiplier, where meeting expectations results in a 100% multiplier and exceeding expectations can lead to a multiplier greater than 100%. Top performers can receive multipliers as high as 300% at companies like Facebook and Apple.

**3. Company Performance:** This factor remains the same for all employees and is based on how well the company is doing.

**Examples:**
- **Bob:** A recent Software Engineering graduate with a base salary of $100,000, a seniority multiplier of 10%, exceeded expectations (individual performance multiplier of 200%), and a company performance multiplier of 120%. His bonus for the period will be $12,000.

- **Alice:** An Engineering Manager with 10 years of experience, a base salary of $220,000, a seniority multiplier of 20%, exceeded expectations (individual performance multiplier of 150%), and a company performance multiplier of 130%. Her bonus for the period will be $42,900.

4. **Cost of Living and Inflation:**
   Acknowledge concerns about the impending inflation and emphasize your consideration for the cost of living. Convey that you want to ensure financial aspects won't become an issue down the line.
   

The bonus amount can vary significantly, and experienced employees tend to receive a higher proportion of their compensation through bonuses.

**Additional Bonuses/Perks:**

In addition to cash bonuses, some companies offer non-monetary perks that can add value to your overall compensation. These include:

- **Free Meals:** Provided on weekdays, which can result in significant cost savings, particularly in expensive areas like the Bay Area.

- **Relocation Bonus:** Helpful if you are relocating from another location, as it can offset some of the costs associated with moving.

- **Health and Dental Insurance/Plans:** These can be worth several thousand dollars annually and are especially valuable in areas with expensive healthcare.

- **Shuttle Service:** This service can save money on transportation costs and make commuting more convenient, particularly in areas with limited public transportation options.

- **Free Education Resources & Certifications:** Access to educational resources and certifications can enhance your skills and market value, which is a valuable long-term benefit.
- Learning and development(L&D) budget
