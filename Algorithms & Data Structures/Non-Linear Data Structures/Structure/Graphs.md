don't focus on too much for interview


Graph from discrete math with everything connecting to each other in some way by edges and vertices are also known as nodes  
  
Graphs are naturally concurrent meaning several things are happening at the same time  
  
Edges and vertices are usually in ordered or unordered pairs  
  
Edges are identified by the unique endpoints and can be of two types which are directed and undirected  
  
Directed it's usually ordered pairs consisting of origin and destination  
  
An undirected is usually unordered and is bidirectional and origin and destination isn't fixed  
  
A graph can consist of both directed and undirected edges  
  
  
Graphs can also be weighted and unweighted meaning the edges can have values when it comes to a weighted as opposed to unweighted where there are no values associated with the edges the reason that there are values associated with the edges when it comes to weighted is to determine the shortest path  
  
Graphs can be acyclic or cyclic meaning it could be like a triangle with three lines connecting each other or acyclic meaning the three lines don't all connect so it can almost look like an "L"  
  
cyclic graphs tend to be weighted and are used a lot for Google maps of all time this is my favorite crap  
  
Graphs can be built with trees and a linked list  
  
And edgeless is basically an array that stores nested pairs that are connected to each other  
  
Use object for graphs instead of arrays  
  
Graphs are good for relationships but are hard for scaling up  
  
Application of graphs

Social media and websites like LinkedIn where you're connected to different people and they are connected to other people on your might have similar collections  
  
Web crawlers which use graph traversal what's your time to see and search engines when you searching for a website  
  
Graphs are used a lot with Google maps for determining the shortest path to a destination  
  
Trees are considered a type of graph
