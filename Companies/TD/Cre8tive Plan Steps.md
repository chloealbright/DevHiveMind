enter specific dates later


- Identify inputs(O), outputs(KR), and key depencies by having multiple touchpoints before meeting stakeholders
- Identify key stakeholders
- Develop a proposal
- Schedule meetings with Stakeholders to gather data
- Scheldule with higher ups
- Schedule with employees
- Identify key skills of focus
- Reformat and combine data to prepare for decesion analysis
- FInalize decesion
- Follow up with Stack holders
- Revist and check what other things need to be addressed
- Research tools 


The timeline for this process varied because it depended on the availability of stakeholders and employees for meetings. It is important to allow enough time to thoroughly research the companies technology used and develop a strong proposal, and prepare presentation materials.

## Practioners

After meeting with the stakeholders and obtaining their input, the next step in implementing a technical upskilling program is to meet with the employees to gather their input on what skills they are interested in learning. Here is a step-by-step list of the process:

1.  Schedule a meeting with employees: Schedule a meeting with all employees who will be impacted by the upskilling program. Consider the best time and location for the meeting and ensure that all employees are aware of the meeting.
    
2.  Explain the purpose of the meeting: Start the meeting by explaining the purpose of the meeting and why their input is important. Make sure to communicate that the goal is to provide them with opportunities to enhance their skills and contribute to the company's growth.
    
3.  Explain the upskilling program: Provide an overview of the technical upskilling program, including its objectives, benefits, and how it will be implemented. This will give employees a clear idea of what they can expect from the program.
    
4.  Encourage employee feedback: Allow employees to share their thoughts, opinions, and ideas. Create a comfortable atmosphere that encourages open communication and sharing.
    
5.  Ask specific questions: Ask employees specific questions to help identify their interests, such as:
    

-   What technical skills do you currently have?
-   What technical skills do you want to learn?
-   How do you want to learn these skills? (e.g., online courses, in-person training, on-the-job training)
-   What types of projects interest you?
-   What types of skills do you think are most important for the company to focus on?

6.  Collect feedback: Record the feedback received from employees and ensure that all feedback is heard. Compile the feedback and analyze it to identify common themes and areas of interest.
    
7.  Analyze feedback: Use the feedback to identify which skills and topics to prioritize in the upskilling program. This will help ensure that the program meets the needs and interests of the employees.
    
8.  Communicate next steps: After analyzing the feedback, communicate the next steps to employees. Let them know what skills will be focused on in the upskilling program and how it will be implemented. This will help employees feel involved and invested in the program.
