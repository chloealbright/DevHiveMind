Dictionaries are abstract data type which means they could be implemented with arrays, linked list, hash tables, tries, and other stuff that let you associate keys with values and you use the keys to look up things just like in a dictionary what you look up a word and get the definition which is the value in this example  
  
dictionaries aren't perfect like if you are searching for something and they have the same name you going to end up having things getting stacked on each other
