Apache Kafka is often categorized as a distributed streaming platform or event streaming platform rather than a traditional message queue or message broker. While it shares some similarities with message queues, Kafka is designed for high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and distributed event streaming. It allows you to publish and subscribe to streams of records, store those records in a fault-tolerant manner, and process them in real-time or batch.
