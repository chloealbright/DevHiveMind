Now onto the Series A maths. By now the company has used the seed round to validate its product market fit. It has raised this latest round ($3M to $8M) to deploy a go to market strategy. 

Let’s look again at the number of employees by round: 

Startups will add anywhere from 20 to 40 employees during this round. As part of the fundraising, the company is expected issue up to 5% of stock options. Essentially, that means the company will be able to give 0.125% to 0.25% of its equity to new employees (again with exceptions for exceptional hires). 

It’s assumed all companies issue a stock option pool during their series A. Therefore you shouldn’t find yourself in the position of joining and having to wait next round for stock options. 

Results: Assuming a 0.1875% stake and one further fundraising round, had you joined Facebook at that stage, you would own ~$61M at IPO. Had you joined Whatsapp at that stage, at its sale to Facebook, you would own ~$24M. Had you joined Instagram at that stage, at it sale to Facebook, you would own ~$1.2M. Had you joined Mint.com at that stage, at it sale to Intuit, you would own ~$210k.
