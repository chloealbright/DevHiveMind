pe ratio lesser than then is awesome at 15 fair above or equal to 20 overpriced and greater than 30 extreme bubble very risky  
  
p/e ratio may not match up right because it is calculated every quarter  
  
something like amazon is considered extreme bubble because it is greater than 30 when it comes to p/e ratio but a lot of people think it has a bright future which is good
