## **Conducting Effective Conversations for Requirements Gathering:**

As a Business Systems Analyst (BSA), engaging in purposeful conversations is critical. Ensure a structured approach by adhering to the following sequence:

1. **Ask Questions in this Order:**

*Interrogative pronoun*
   - **What(broadest question of them all):** Identify different scenarios and dependencies.

*Interrogative adverbs - used to ask questions about manner, place, time, or reason.*
   - **Why:** Uncover the root causes at various scopes, using creative and indirect queries.
	   - Other way of asking why  
		   - Can you tell me what's leading you to this request  
		   - Do you have any perspective on where... 
		   - Is there any reason this wouldn't have...   
	   - Instead of asking why directly which can offend or make people feel type away you can be creative as the top example shows  
	   - Then you can actually ask why for the question you want to ask so you basically kind of want to build up to the why while still asking why in the above examples 
   - **Which:** Pinpoint specific points or compare options.
   - **How:** Identify the necessary steps.
   - **When:** Determine the timeline.
   - **Where:** Identify the location.

   Start with open-ended questions, transitioning to closed-ended ones for specific information and decisive responses.
   
   Pose both contextual and non-contextual questions to extract additional information. For instance, you can introduce queries with phrases like "so, off-topic," allowing for a broader exploration of relevant details.
   
2. **Privacy Considerations:**
   - Safeguard private information, especially when formulating plans.
   - Be aware of the organizational culture and people's temperament.
   - Assess how the work may impact stakeholders, identifying supporters and non-supporters.

## **Setting up Meetings for Strategic Conversations:**

Before scheduling a meeting, clearly define the problem statement and the meeting's purpose. Attach an agenda to the email, including thought-provoking questions to guide discussions.

## **Key Considerations for Conversations:**

- Decide on the type of conversations required, participants, focus subjects, and allocate effort accordingly.

## **Conversation Tactics:**

- Encourage participation by making statements and inviting corrections.
- Rephrase answers to ensure alignment with participants.

## **Objectives of Conversations:**

- Identify inputs, outputs, dependencies, data, needs, and wants.
- Explore other ideas for potential future discussions.

## **Action Items:**

- Send questions in advance if required; otherwise, provide an agenda with topics.
- Document and table out-of-scope ideas.
- Utilize surveys, workshops, or focus groups for comprehensive discussions.
- Distinguish between known and unknown aspects.
- Conduct SWOT analysis.

## **Meeting Dynamics:**

- If a meeting is missed, request action points.
- Group and categorize stakeholders.
- Establish a requirements baseline by determining the project type—predictive or adaptive.

   - Predictive projects involve formal processes, complex change control, and scope documentation.
   - Adaptive projects involve informal processes, streamlined change control, and a focus on the product backlog.

- Scrutinize documentation for essential questions.

## **Post-Meeting Actions:**

- Before concluding, ask for additional questions or topics that may have been missed.
- Close out the meeting and follow up, especially if extensive information was discussed, to verify details.
