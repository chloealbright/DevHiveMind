Embracing the power of a reverse interview ask about things like:

- **Manager Dynamics:**
    - What aspects do they appreciate or find challenging about their current manager?
    - Could you shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of my potential future manager?

- **Team Dynamics:**
    - Who was the most recent team member to receive a promotion, and what qualities contributed to their advancement?
    - Equally important, who departed from the team, and what motivated their decision to leave?

- **Managerial Support:**
    - How supportive is the manager in terms of fostering professional growth and addressing challenges within the team?

This proactive approach provides invaluable insights into the managerial landscape, offering a nuanced understanding of team dynamics, managerial styles, and the overall work culture. Moreover, it exemplified the wisdom of "under promise, over deliver" â€“ a strategic mantra that aligns with managing expectations and exceeding them.

Additionally, recognizing the importance of authenticity, especially in sensitive matters, such as reporting workplace issues, was emphasized. Acknowledging one's identity, such as sexual orientation, in navigating HR processes and fostering open communication emerged as a pragmatic piece of advice.

In essence, the reverse interview not only illuminated the path towards a well-informed decision but also underscored the significance of strategic questioning and authentic communication in the professional realm.

## Other Questions Example

Why did you move to Amsterdam? What made you move away from HQ? (Both my future manager and the most senior engineer moved)  
  
Why do you think Uber moved something so key like Payments to a small site? I was very skeptical of any sensible company moving strategic work away from the HQ, so I circled around this question throughout my "reverse interviews".  
  
What are the last three projects you've shipped? Then I asked more about one that sounded the most interesting, to get a sense of the work - this was especially helpful when talking with the engineer.  
  
What is the project you're most proud of working on at Uber? Why?  
  
What is the biggest struggle you have/had at Uber? Why?  
  
What are you most excited about for the next six months?  
  
What did your typical workweek look like the past month?  
  
Tell me about the team. How would you describe the team dynamics? Again, I got very good - and blunt - feedback from the senior engineer.  
  
Assuming I joined, what advice would you give to be successful?  
  
What are things that you have seen new joiners struggle with?  
  
Has anyone left the team? If so, what was the reason?
