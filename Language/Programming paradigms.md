## Programming Paradigms



- **Separation of Data and Procedure:** Unlike OOP, functional programming separates data and procedures.
- **Prologue Programming:** Similar to discrete math concepts like De Morgan's law and implications.


## JavaScript Specifics

- **JavaScript and Runtime:** JavaScript's runtime behavior, like the performance of length property, depends on the language. For JavaScript, it's typically constant runtime.
- **Private Methods:** JavaScript doesn't have private methods, but developers use an underscore naming convention to signal that certain properties or methods shouldn't be accessed, even though they technically can be.
- **Data Structures:** JavaScript doesn't have built-in linked lists, stacks, or queues; you have to build them.
- **Middleware:** Middleware often involves creating business logic using database functions.
