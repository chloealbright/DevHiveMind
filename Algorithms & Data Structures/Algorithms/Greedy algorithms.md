## Greedy Algorithm Relationship to Top k elements

The relationship between greedy algorithms and the "Top k elements" pattern lies in the fact that both involve selecting a subset of elements based on some criteria. While not all problems related to selecting top k elements can be solved greedily, some scenarios do align with the greedy algorithmic paradigm.  
  
In the "Top k elements" pattern, the goal is often to identify or retrieve the k elements with the highest or lowest values from a collection. This pattern is commonly encountered in data analysis, ranking, and optimization problems.  
  
Greedy algorithms can be applied to some variations of the "Top k elements" pattern, where at each step, the algorithm makes a locally optimal choice. For example, in selecting the top k elements based on their values, a greedy approach might involve iteratively choosing the element with the highest value until k elements are selected.  
  
It's important to note that while greedy algorithms can be effective in certain cases, they don't always guarantee the globally optimal solution. Careful consideration of the problem constraints and characteristics is needed to determine whether a greedy approach is suitable for a specific instance of the "Top k elements" pattern.
