Primitive wrappers, also known as wrapper classes, are classes in programming languages that provide an object-oriented representation of primitive types. These classes allow primitive types to be used in contexts that require objects. Here's a list of primitive wrappers across different programming languages:

1. Java:
   - Integer: Represents an int value.
   - Double: Represents a double value.
   - Boolean: Represents a boolean value.
   - Character: Represents a char value.
   - Byte: Represents a byte value.
   - Short: Represents a short value.
   - Long: Represents a long value.
   - Float: Represents a float value.

2. C#:
   - Int32: Represents an int value.
   - Double: Represents a double value.
   - Boolean: Represents a boolean value.
   - Char: Represents a char value.
   - Byte: Represents a byte value.
   - Int16: Represents a short value.
   - Int64: Represents a long value.
   - Single: Represents a float value.

3. Python:
   - int: Represents an integer value.
   - float: Represents a floating-point value.
   - bool: Represents a boolean value.
   - str: Represents a string value.

4. JavaScript:
   - Number: Represents a numeric value (both integer and floating-point).
   - Boolean: Represents a boolean value.
   - String: Represents a string value.
   Typescript
   - BigInt: Represents a wrapper object for arbitrary precision integers. It allows you to perform operations on large integers beyond the range of the number type.
   - Symbol: Represents a wrapper object for unique symbols. It provides methods and properties related to symbol values.

5. Ruby:
   - Integer: Represents an integer value.
   - Float: Represents a floating-point value.
   - Boolean: Represents a boolean value.
   - String: Represents a string value.

6. Swift:
   - Int: Represents an integer value.
   - Double: Represents a double value.
   - Bool: Represents a boolean value.
   - Character: Represents a character value.
   - Float: Represents a float value.

These are just a few examples of primitive wrappers across different programming languages. It's important to note that the naming and availability of these wrappers may vary between languages, so it's always best to refer to the documentation of the specific programming language you're working with.
