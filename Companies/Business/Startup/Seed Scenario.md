At the seed level, the startup has completed its first and only fundraise (anywhere from €300k to €1.5M). The company has already started selling its product (or service) but is looking for additional employees to help it bring it to the market and test it. Below is an average number of employees during each round: 

The company has issued a stock option plan during its last fundraising: You’re in luck. Your strike price is the Seed fundraising share price. On average seed startups will issue from 2% to 8% of stock options (from the fully diluted shares). If a CTO is needed, he may get 1% to 4%. Other employees will typically split the rest, adjusted for experience, seniority, needs of the company, and skillset. You typically can ask for 0.25% to 2.0%. 

The company has NOT issued a stock option during its last fundraising: Then it’s a little trickier again. You will be promised stock options that will happen in the next fundraising. And the issue is, the strike price will probably be at the next fundraising share price. So essentially you will work for up to 18 months before your upside is based on value creation post-Series A. In this case, make sure you negotiate a higher stake. Expect 0.50% up to 4.0%. 

Caveat! If you really want to get more equity and maybe become a co-founder at this point (or what startups call Founding Team to differentiate from actual founders), you have two solutions, often intertwined: 

1. Invest hard cash into the business, and 

2. Accept a pay cut from your expected salary. 

As such, you may get higher than 4% of capital all the way to 10% if the amount was substantial. 

Results: Assuming a 1% stake and several further fundraising rounds, had you joined Facebook at that stage, you would own ~$244M at IPO. Had you joined Whatsapp at that stage, at its sale to Facebook, you would own ~$97M. Had you joined Instagram at that stage, at it sale to Facebook, you would own ~$4.9M. Had you joined Mint.com at that stage, at it sale to Intuit, you would own ~$830k.
