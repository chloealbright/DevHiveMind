PHP, with its Zend Engine, serves as both [[Compiler]] and [[Runtime]] for the PHP scripting language. In contrast, Node utilizes the V8 engine. PHP is synchronous language offering tools for server installation, often used with Apache/ISS, while Node which is asynchronous operates as a JavaScript runtime, often with Express for dedicated servers. Composer is now a standard PHP package manager, whereas Node has NPM. PHP traditionally pairs with RDBMS like MySQL, while Node excels with NoSQL databases like MongoDB.

PHP suits a variety of applications, from personal blogs to enterprise-level projects, especially when using PHP-based CMS or frameworks like WordPress or Laravel. Node is ideal for real-time, scalable applications, such as chat or logging apps, and is preferred for SPAs when using front-end technologies like React, AngularJS, or Vue.js. Ultimately, the choice between PHP and Node depends on your application's specific requirements.
