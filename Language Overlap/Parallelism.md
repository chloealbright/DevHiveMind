```javascript
// Creating new web workers
const worker1 = new Worker('worker.js');
const worker2 = new Worker('worker.js');
const worker3 = new Worker('worker.js');

// Handling messages from the workers
worker1.onmessage = function(event) {
  console.log('Worker 1 result:', event.data);
};

worker2.onmessage = function(event) {
  console.log('Worker 2 result:', event.data);
};

worker3.onmessage = function(event) {
  console.log('Worker 3 result:', event.data);
};

// Starting parallel tasks
worker1.postMessage(10);
worker2.postMessage(20);
worker3.postMessage(30);
```



```javascript
// Handling messages from the main script
self.onmessage = function(event) {
  const data = event.data;
  console.log('Received data:', data);

  // Perform some computation
  const result = processData(data);

  // Send the result back to the main script
  self.postMessage(result);
};

// Example computation function
function processData(data) {
  // Perform computation on data
  const result = data * 2;

  // Simulating some delay
  const startTime = Date.now();
  while (Date.now() - startTime < 2000) {}

  return result;
}
```

In this example, we create three web workers (`worker1`, `worker2`, and `worker3`) by instantiating the `Worker` object and providing the URL of the worker script (`worker.js`). The worker script contains the computation logic.

The `onmessage` event handlers in the main script listen for messages sent by the workers. Each worker performs its computation by receiving the data from the main script, executing the `processData` function, and sending the result back to the main script using `self.postMessage()`.

When you run the code, the main script will create three web workers and send different data values to each worker. Each worker will perform the computation in parallel and send the result back to the main script. The main script will log the received results from each worker.

Web workers allow parallelism in JavaScript by executing code in separate threads, allowing tasks to be performed concurrently. In this example, the web workers run in parallel, and the computations carried out by each worker can occur simultaneously, utilizing the available CPU cores.
