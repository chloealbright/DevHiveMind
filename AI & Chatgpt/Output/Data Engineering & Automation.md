Nerd Alert  
  
As a developer, I find myself facing an interesting challenge as I transition back into Java, which was my first programming language and paved the way for my tech career. After focusing on full-stack web development using JavaScript for a while, I'm excited to return to Java and fill in any gaps in my knowledge. This process has been rewarding, as I'm getting to work with one of my favorite languages again and learn new things. As technology continues to evolve, it's important to remember where you came from and stay up to date with the latest advancements in your field.
