```typescript
function twoSum(nums: number[], target: number): number[] {
    // Step 1
    const numMap: Record<number, number> = {};

    // Step 2
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        // Step 3
        const complement = target - nums[i];

        // Step 4
        if (complement in numMap) {
            // Step 5
            return [numMap[complement], i];
        }

        // Step 6
        numMap[nums[i]] = i;
    }

    // Step 7
    throw new Error("No valid solution found");
}

// Step 8: Example Usage
const nums1 = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const target1 = 9;
console.log(twoSum(nums1, target1)); // Output: [0, 1]

// Repeat Step 8 for other examples...
```

## Steps

1. **Initialize a Hash Map**: Create an empty hash map to store the indices of elements.

2. **Loop through the Array**: Iterate through the given array of numbers.

3. **Calculate Complement**: For each element in the array, calculate the complement by subtracting it from the target.

4. **Check if Complement in Map**: Check if the complement is already present in the hash map.

5. **Return Indices if Found**: If the complement is in the map, return the indices of the current element and the complement.

6. **Store Current Element in Map**: If the complement is not in the map, store the current element along with its index in the hash map.

7. **Handle No Solution**: If the loop completes without finding a solution, throw an error indicating that no valid solution was found.

8. **Example Usage**: Use the function with example arrays and targets to verify its correctness.



## Plain English Steps 

1. **Prepare for Tracking**: Imagine setting up a system to keep track of numbers and their positions.

2. **Look Through the List**: Go through the list of numbers one by one.

3. **Find a Pairing Strategy**: For each number, figure out another number that, when combined, equals the target sum.

4. **Check if You've Seen It Before**: See if you've encountered this special number before in your journey.

5. **Declare Success if Found**: If you've seen it before, celebrate! You've found two numbers that add up to the target.

6. **Remember for the Future**: If this special number is new, make a mental note of it for future reference.

7. **Express Failure if Nothing Works**: If you go through the whole list without finding a solution, admit that it seems impossible in this case.

8. **Example Scenarios**: Test your system with a few scenarios to make sure it's working as expected.
