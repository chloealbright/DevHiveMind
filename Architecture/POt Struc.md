Homepage for each folder category  
  
  
You can still create daily notes and have a note for the week  
  
What within that daily note you can have branching out notes that it connects to basically where the they know is the parent and it has children nodes of notes the week  
  
Can create a daily note template with a template for each note category to that day  
  
  
Weekly note can be a review of the week or a refinement of the daily note same for the monthly note  
  
  
Maybe reserve categories for weekly notes instead of daily
