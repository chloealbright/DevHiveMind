"In the realm of programming, a 'build' represents a specific version of a software program. Typically, it's a pre-release iteration distinguished by a unique build number rather than a formal release number. In simpler terms, a software build is a collection of executable code that's prepared for use by end-users.

Building an application involves several essential steps, such as compiling the source code, assembling all required components, and creating an executable software version. This process includes compiling the code, linking libraries, packaging assets, and producing installation packages or container images.

The 'Build' encompasses the complete procedure required to create a 'deliverable' of your software. In the context of Java, this often involves generating sources, compiling sources and test sources, executing various tests (including unit and integration tests), packaging the software into formats like JAR, WAR, EJB-JAR, or EAR, running health checks using static analyzers (such as Checkstyle, Findbugs, and PMD), and generating reports. Notably, compiling is just one aspect of the broader build process, and modern best practices call for full automation of these steps using tools like Maven or Ant. This process can be run continuously, a practice known as Continuous Integration.

## Build Tools

- In the realm of deployment tools, we covered Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible, GitHub Actions, and Docker in the Simulator without writing code officially. If you're interested in diving deeper into these tools, here's a brief overview:

    - Jenkins: This tool is used to continuously build and test software projects, making it easier for developers to integrate changes into a project.

    - Ansible: It's a configuration management tool that automates tasks like provisioning and configuration management.

    - Terraform: Terraform serves as an 'infrastructure as code' tool, helping create, modify, and enhance infrastructure safely.

    - Docker: Docker packages an application and its dependencies into a container that can be executed across various environments.

    - AWS (Amazon Web Services)

    - GitHub Actions"
