In JavaScript, a sort method may not work the way you expect like if your sorting just letters it will work fine but numbers are a different case because javascript converts numbers to string specifically using charCodeAt which uses Unicode.  
  
also depending on the browser the sort may change in terms of Big O  
  
so make sure you know how you're built-in methods work  
  
depending on the language it can vary depending on the language built-in sorting method implementation  
  
Don't focus on sorting algorithms for interviews too much
