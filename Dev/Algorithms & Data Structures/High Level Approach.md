Brute force -> Naive -> Greedy algorithm(some what Optimal approach) -> Optimal approach(true optimal)

Tend to be linear in work and may included sorting  
  
A greedy algorithm is a simple, intuitive algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic(any approach) of making the locally optimal choice at each stage of the algorithm to get an overall optimal solution. However, in many problems, a greedy strategy does not produce an optimal solution.  
  
  
It is very simple quick and easy to code and is considered optimal in terms of making the first immediate optimal choice but not accessing the overall optimal approach that is why it can be bad  
  
but some times can be okay for simple straight forward problems
