Patterns play a crucial role in problem-solving. Understanding when to apply a specific pattern is essential. However, real-world scenarios can be tricky. Our brains are wired to seek efficiency. When faced with a problem, we instinctively look for the path of perceived least resistance.
Sometimes, this leads us to consider brute-force approaches because you lack familiarity with specific patterns or algorithms. Here are a few considerations:

1. **Pattern Application vs. Implementation Difficulty**:
    - Sometimes, even if you recognize a pattern, implementing it can be challenging. You might encounter problems where the straightforward approach (outside the pattern) is more feasible due to perceived complexities in applying the pattern.
    - Balancing pattern knowledge with practical implementation skills is key.
2. **English Problem Breakdown vs. Syntax Implementation**:
    
    - While coding, you often switch between two mental modes:
        - **English Mode**: Breaking down the problem conceptually, discussing it in English, and understanding the high-level process.
        - **Syntax Mode**: Figuring out the actual implementation details, considering syntax, data structures, and algorithms.
    - Bridging this gap can be tricky, especially for beginners.
3. **Navigating Viability and Pivoting**:
    
    - Identifying when a chosen path isn‚Äôt viable is crucial. Sometimes, persistence on a specific approach leads to dead ends.
    - Knowing when to pivot‚Äîswitching strategies or exploring alternative approaches‚Äîis a valuable skill. It prevents getting stuck and opens up new possibilities.

4. **Awareness of Alternatives**:
    - Lack of awareness about alternative approaches can limit problem-solving. Exploring different methods broadens your toolkit.
    - Stay curious and learn from others‚Äô solutions to expand your repertoire.

5. **Technical Interview Tip**:
    - During technical interviews, time is precious. You‚Äôre juggling problem-solving, coding, and communication.
    - **Ask the Interviewer**: Before diving into an approach, inquire if they think a pattern applies. This prevents premature commitment and allows you to pivot if needed.
    - Interviews are conversations. It‚Äôs okay to seek clarification or discuss your thought process.

Remember, problem-solving is both an art and a science. Embrace challenges, iterate, and keep learning! üöÄüîçüåü
