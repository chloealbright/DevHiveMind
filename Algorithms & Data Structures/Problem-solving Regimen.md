1. **Focus on One Problem:**  
- Identify problem area.
- Pick one problem something simple like an array question or something.
  
2. **Bruteforce Solution:**  
- Come up with a Bruteforce solution to gain insight into the problem's dynamics.  
  
3. **Naive Solution:**  
- Develop a naive solution, distinct from the Bruteforce approach.  
- Space out attempts, allowing time for fresh perspectives.
- The Naive solution can be done Imperatively or Declarative consider doing both ways to see if you can do it.
- Lastly consider runtime complexity and data structures brainstorming thinking about their application in terms of access, searching, insertion, and deletion.  

  
4. **Optimal Solution & Grokking Algorithm Patterns:**  
- Develop a Optimal approach
- Consider experiment with looping iteratively and recursively.  
- Delve into advanced algorithm patterns for solution. 
- Think about what patterns can be used for the problem which can be solved with many different patterns depending on the problem itself.
- Keep in mind that one pattern may be more Optimal then the other.
- Also think about Sorting algorithms, create helper functions for code modularity also naming convention.
