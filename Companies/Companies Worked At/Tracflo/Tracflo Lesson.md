Worked on the GetLetterByID endpoint, delving into the complexities of simultaneous codebase changes, including TypeScript interfaces and the incorporation of new utils, necessitating code refactoring. Faced the challenge of comprehending and efficiently reading code without initial tests, leading to the identification and visualization of the codebase structure on whiteboard.

Navigated potential pitfalls, such as issues between integration tests and endpoints, SQL fixtures, and different layers like Controller, data, model, routes, and service layer. Gained experience in reading errors across a large codebase and honed skills in debugging various parts of the system.

Realized the importance of balance in learning â€“ recognizing when to seek help and avoiding the pitfalls of attempting everything independently, which can lead to burnout. 


This is very important because not seeking help contradicts the essence of software development in my opinion in terms of the one the main philosophy of engineering which is creating efficient, reusable, and modular code. I have learned that this philosophy specifically being efficient extends beyond coding itself, encompassing the broader efficiency in processes both within and outside coding, and in decision making in life in general.


When you look at your brain and imagine it was a program that is running 24/7 you would want to be very efficient with how you use it, you would want to focus on problem without fixating on a single issue amidst multiple challenges. Discussed the importance of overcoming short-term concerns about bothering others and transitioning to asking more questions, reducing stress, enhancing mental clarity, and fostering curiosity.

Highlighted the need to discern when to persevere independently and when to seek help, considering the potential impact on other developers' work and time constraints. Overall, emphasized the continual evolution in mindset and approach for a more effective and sustainable software development journey.
