Here is a list of commonly used primitive types across various programming languages:

1. Integer:
   - C/C++: int, short, long, char
   - Java: int, short, long, byte, char
   - Python: int

2. Floating-Point:
   - C/C++: float, double
   - Java: float, double
   - Python: float

3. Boolean:
   - C/C++: bool
   - Java: boolean
   - Python: bool

4. Character:
   - C/C++: char
   - Java: char
   - Python: str (although not strictly a primitive type, it behaves similarly for individual characters)

5. String:
   - C/C++: Not a built-in primitive type. C-style strings are represented as character arrays.
   - Java: String
   - Python: str

6. Byte:
   - C/C++: Not a built-in primitive type. Can be represented using unsigned char or char.
   - Java: byte

7. Short:
   - C/C++: short
   - Java: short

8. Long:
   - C/C++: long
   - Java: long

9. Double:
   - C/C++: double
   - Java: double
   - Python: float

10. Float:
    - C/C++: float
    - Java: float
    - Python: float

11. Void:
    - C/C++: void (used to indicate a function with no return value)
    - Java: void (used to indicate a method with no return value)
    - Python: No direct equivalent

Please note that this list is not exhaustive, and there may be additional or different primitive types depending on the programming language. Additionally, some languages may have variations or aliases for these types.


## Symbol

1. Symbol as a primitive type:
   - Ruby: Ruby has a primitive type called "Symbol". Symbols are immutable, unique identifiers represented by a colon followed by a name, such as `:my_symbol`.

2. Symbol as a distinct type:
   - JavaScript: JavaScript has a distinct data type called "Symbol". Symbols are unique and immutable values often used as keys in object properties to avoid naming conflicts.

3. Symbol-like types:
   - Some languages may not have a specific "symbol" type but offer similar concepts:
     - Python: While Python doesn't have a primitive "symbol" type, strings can be used as immutable and unique identifiers for various purposes.

It's important to note that the availability and categorization of primitive types can differ between languages, so it's always best to consult the documentation or specifications of the specific programming language you're working with to determine the existence and nature of a "symbol" type.
