A lot of Attacks maybe done with c language because of how fast it is 

## Security Policy 

Website availability or data availability 

Data confidentiality 

Data integrity meaning who can modify data 

SSL/TLS 

Ex: account recovery 

## Threat model 

assumption about attackers like do they have my password or are there to my system or do they have any tools to attack my system 

## Software, Hardware, & System Mechanisms 

Icloud hack had a lot of services interfacing with the iCloud like find my iPhone or photos etc.. 

And with all of these interfaces Apple didn't have verification interface for all their services specifically find my iPhone which allowed them to use it to get access to iCloud 

Is where doing something like limiting the amount of login attempts you can do in a day can slow down people and protect your system 

## Buffer overflow 

## injection attack 

## Broken authentication 

sensitive data exposure. More often than not, the APIs don't protect properly sensitive information and therefore easily provides opportunities for identity theft and other bad information leaks. The fourth one is XML entities. Older or poorly written XML processors can be exploited with XML injection with hostile content. And the last one is broken access control 

To improve security minimize the number of mechanisms you are using and use small components to secure your system that are mainly focused on security
