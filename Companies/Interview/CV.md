Dear Company Recruitment, 

After researching your company and its commitment to [Company Value or Goal], I am eager to apply for the Full-Stack Engineer position. With a background in developing and maintaining web applications, as well as supporting fellow software engineers in a Business Systems Analyst (BSA) capacity, I am confident in my ability to excel in this role. I am passionate about the process of strategizing, designing, and constructing data models, coupled with mapping out the functionality of an application. This parallels the way an architect builds a structure based on a meticulously crafted blueprint. This is a key factor in why I identify as a software carpenter, who will become a software architect.




I have learned many things, like how the development process can be like a relay race where the work that you put into a feature can be a dependency for another teammates work & the overall codebase functionality while working at TracFlo, were I built 13+ features that allowed 50+ general contractors and subcontracting companies to manage projects with up to 35+ active users, each with varying roles and permissions. I also worked on a feature that enabled users to create, edit, and get all equipment and materials within a ticket, which averaged 135+ tickets created per company project. 

Algorithmic thinking 


Working as a software engineer provides a strong foundation for Business Systems Analyst (BSA) roles. The ability to think algorithmically means you can dissect business processes, identify requirements, and formulate effective solutions. Software engineers are adept at recognizing patterns, optimizing processes, and creating scalable systems, all crucial aspects of both coding and BSA work.

In the realm of BSA, a software engineer's analytical mindset proves invaluable when translating business needs into technical specifications. Understanding algorithms helps in designing workflows and anticipating potential issues, contributing to the seamless integration of technology to meet business objectives. The overlap between software engineering and BSA work underscores the importance of algorithmic thinking in efficiently bridging the gap between business goals and technical implementation.





so it is important to communicate. In my previous position as a BSA I put these skillsets into practice by were I collaborated with a third-party upskilling firm to develop and implement an internal upskilling program. This involved supporting software engineers in setting up WSL along with Docker and resulted in upskilling over 200+ software engineers across 10 cohorts in a span of 5 months, covering Advanced Java, Spring Boot, Docker, Event-Driven Architecture, and Reactive Programming.


## Conclusion


I am excited about the opportunity to bring my skills and experience to [Company] and contribute to its success. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team in more detail. 

Sincerely, [Your Name] [Your Contact Information]
