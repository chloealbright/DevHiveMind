Private APIs can be applied in a variety of ways: 

Private APIs can be used to create apps to release to the public. This model is often used by large brands with the resources to develop apps and who want to control what their public apps do. After all, who knows your brand, your content, and your service offering better than you do? 

Private APIs can be used by partners to create apps or to implement integration services. Many SaaS companies offer this type of API. Think of software companies that offer integration services with Salesforce 

Private APIs can be used as a way to more efficiently build apps for internal use in an organization. For example, a large manufacturing company uses APIs to enable developers to build executive dashboards for distribution on tablet devices instead of requiring developers to request access to backend systems directly 

Private APIs can enable rapid and scalable development for mobile strategies, allowing each mobile product team to build apps quickly without worrying about how to populate them with content. 

There is often a pent-up demand for access to the business assets that are exposed in an API that leads to a quick return on any investment. Private APIs can help simplify an IT infrastructure to meet that demand. 

Private APIs can improve business development as they make it much easier and faster for partners to integrate (with the added benefit of making your service more sticky), requiring relatively little oversight and time from your own internal resources. 

Risks Related to Private APIs 

It’s not a new idea to create apps with reusable business assets and for those apps to support the business. The reason that APIs are now succeeding both in the private and public realm is that the way to make them useful has finally been discovered. 

In part, APIs are now successful because they are productized, and they allow for true self-service that makes communication more efficient between the API provider and the developers who use it. The power of an API diminishes dramatically if the only people who can use it are the experts who created it. For an API to be truly useful, it must be productized so that others can use it themselves. Using an API internally does not change this principle, although some implementation details may be different. 

A prominent danger in private use of APIs is not only skimping on self-service, but also failing to provide operational support that allows the API to be relied on as a production asset. You must be serious about making sure that an API is always on if you are going to provide it. If people cannot rely on the stability and speed of an API, if they cannot tell when it is working, if they are not informed of changes, developers will not rely on the API and it will fail. 

Another issue related to the private use of APIs is not marketing or evangelizing it. It’s just as important to actively drive adoption and evangelize private APIs to employees and partners just as you would public APIs. The point is not to just put the API out there and expect colleagues to find it and use it. It’s also important to do some education about how to use the API and not assume that everyone will see and understand its applications. Regarding his work on the New York Times API, Derek Gottfrid said, “We did a lot of internal education. In the beginning, some organizations didn’t know what an API was—one thought it stood for Associated Press International!” Brad Stenger, Developer Advocate at the New York Times, says that internal education is ongoing. “If we mention APIs at any large meeting or workshop, we still provide a very basic explanation of what they are and how we use them. Although we’ve used APIs for years, to many they’re still more unknown than well-known.”
