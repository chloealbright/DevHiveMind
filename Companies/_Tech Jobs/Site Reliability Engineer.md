A Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) is a professional who is responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining reliable and scalable systems and services in a company's infrastructure. The goal of an SRE is to ensure that the systems and services are available, reliable, and performant for the end-users.

SREs typically have a background in software engineering, system administration, or operations. They work closely with development teams to ensure that the applications and systems they build are scalable and reliable, and that they can be deployed and operated efficiently in production environments.

SREs use a combination of automation, monitoring, and incident management techniques to ensure that systems are available and performant. They design and implement automated processes to manage deployments, upgrades, and rollbacks, and they use monitoring tools to detect and diagnose issues before they affect end-users. When issues do occur, SREs work quickly to resolve them and prevent them from happening again in the future.

In addition to technical skills, SREs must also have strong communication and collaboration skills. They work closely with other teams, such as development, operations, and product management, to ensure that systems and services are meeting the needs of the business and the end-users.

Overall, Site Reliability Engineers play a critical role in ensuring that systems and services are reliable, performant, and available for end-users. They help to bridge the gap between development and operations, and they help to ensure that systems and services are designed and operated with the end-user in mind.
