In computer networking, a proxy server is a server application that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource and the server providing that resource.  

## Proxy server vs VPN 

Proxy and VPN defined. A VPN secures all your network traffic, while a proxy works on an application level. They both hide your IP address, but only a VPN redirects your internet data through an encrypted tunnel. A proxy is suitable for browsing the internet, but it's not as safe and secure as a VPN.
