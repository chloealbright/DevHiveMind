Given an array of integersÂ `nums`Â and an integerÂ `target`, returnÂ _indices of the two numbers such that they add up toÂ `target`_.

You may assume that each input would haveÂ **_exactly_Â one solution**, and you may not use theÂ _same_Â element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
**Output:** [0,1]
**Explanation:** Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
**Output:** [1,2]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [3,3], target = 6
**Output:** [0,1]

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `-109 <= target <= 109`
- **Only one valid answer exists.**

Ask Question here and after to verify this is what the question is asking

Given variables nums array with length minimum  of 2 and length maximum of 104 
the numbers in the array range from -109 to 109 and this the same for the target
returning one valid output array with maximum length of 2  containing the two indexes of the values  that add up to target  for each case 

## is anything required in terms of 

### Insertion 
#### best way best average time complexity to 
insert is an array also a stack that is probably implemented by a array or a queue implemented by a link list or using a link list just terms of optimizations around Insertions

or 
### Access(MOST COMMON ACTION)  
#### best way best average time complexity to 
access would be a set if you want to parse out duplicate values, arrays no side effects like the set



### Search 
#### best way best average time complexity to  
use map/hashtable/hashmap also refereed to as a lookup tables for search when it comes to unsorted data 

or

binary search but the data has to be sorted 

or

otherwise use  a set or whatever else data structure since the rest searches at a O(n)




### Deletion 
#### best way best average time complexity to 

when it comes to deletion any can be used it just depends on the deaper use cases outside of runtime since there all delete at a O(n) runtime


depending on what your trying to do you might pick a lesser optimal runtime based data structure based on what functionality  you want to utilize


# Approach
### Given Variables  case 1
nums = `[2,7,11,15]` 
Target = `9`
Return = `[0,1]`

### Given Variables  case 2
nums = `[3,2,4]` 
Target = `6`
Return = `[1,2]`


### Given Variables  case 3
nums = `[2,7,11,15]` 
Target = `9`
Return = `[0,1]`

## Steps Naive Attempt 
**can list steps or some mixture of steps and pseudocode 

Two pointer pattern comes to mind also is probably the most optimal solution if data is sorted by default or if not not sorted the most optimal solution may include leveraging a data structure that is good with dealing with unsorted data like Hashtable/Hashtable/Map often refereed to as lookup tables which has a O(1) runtime for each action category but Search being the key Operation 

**Hash Map Approach:**
- **Pros:**
    - Handles unsorted arrays efficiently.
    - Provides a direct lookup for previously seen numbers.
- **Cons:**
    - Requires additional space for the hash map.




Step 1 - check array size if less then 2 if so return empty 

Step 2 - can declare `left` and `right` pointer can be outside the loop or inside in case access to the values outside the loop isnt of concern 

step 3 - traverse array of nums and store current `sum` of left and right pointer and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">compare</mark> to target 


Step 4 - return indexes of values that match target

 
## Read 
use truth table to identify overlap conditions 
ðŸ”¼ AND ðŸ”½OR

logical implication like `p -> q` from discrete math in the programming context just means if the condition is true then do the action in the if statement body.

| Truth Table |  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 1ðŸ”¼2ðŸ”¼3 | 1ðŸ”½2ðŸ”½3 |  |  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| statement 1 |  | T | T | T | T | T | Placeholder |  |
| statement 2 |  | T | T | F | F | T | Placeholder |  |
| statement 3 |  |  |  |  | T | T | Placeholder |  |
| **Result** |  |  |  |  | P | P |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | Not Likely |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | Proably |  |  |  |
### Two Pointer or any   Approach break down

Pre condition 
- Define Overlapping condition that may apply also keep [[Conditional Logic and Operators#Short circuit evaluation |Short Circuit Evaluation]] same for other overlap condition below
- Check size of array 

loop condition
- Define Overlapping condition that may apply ...
- Create condition to increment and decrement pointers
- Define whatever else  condition are needed 

post condition 
- Define Overlapping condition that may apply...


## Update does a Reads and might return boolean 

- Reassign any variable or add to value or remove or add any values to data structure using or call a helper or built  in function 

### Delete 
Delete any value from data structure the essentially falls under 


are there scenario were the array has multiple values that add up to target one potential edge case but not relevant to this problem
