### Best Practices


Optimize your financial strategy by purchasing appreciating assets, leveraging their growth to secure a loan without triggering taxes. Ensure the asset's appreciation exceeds the loan interest. Use the borrowed funds to invest or make purchases. Additionally, consider acquiring life insurance, using it as collateral to enhance your overall financial portfolio. This approach leverages the asset's growth, manages taxes, and strengthens your financial position.


### Account managers & financial advisors

When seeking a service, such as a broker, request essential credentials like their broker ID or a relevant licenseâ€”information that is public and verifies their professional qualifications. This ensures transparency and helps you make informed decisions while respecting privacy boundaries.
