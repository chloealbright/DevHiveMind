### Evasiveness about why the role exists 

The interview seems to be going well. You have a well-constructed chair, a drink, and the sun isn’t shining directly into your eyes through a slatted blind behind the interviewer’s head. Technical questions go well, there’s no coding test just a general theoretical discussion on the merits of different approaches to problem solving and the pragmatism of development methodologies. 

You start to smile inside, get the nice warm fuzzy feeling, then the interviewer asks if you have any specific questions about the role. 

The sky suddenly turns ominously dark outside. 

I’m always interested, as a software engineer not personally, why a role I’m interviewing for has become available — whether it’s new or become vacant. 

Sometimes it’s a new one for a specific project and the present team lacks the technical ability so needs someone who has it or they need to expand the number of people to cater for a higher work load. Other times it’s because someone on the team has left the company and it’s in this case where I try to dig a little deeper if I can. 

Remember you’re interviewing them as much as they’re interviewing you. 

Often enough a well versed human interviewer will happily discuss why the role has become available but a red flag starts its long way way up the pole if they become evasive or flat out refuse to discuss it. 

It’s not often you’re interviewing for top secret roles, though they do happen, and discussion of the technologies and sometimes the team are completely verboten. But, generally, if the interviewer avoids the reason then I tend to assume that it’s because the previous incumbent left on uncertain terms or that the role, if discussed, is unfillable — i.e. they can’t find someone to take it once they know why it’s free. 

I’ve interviewed for roles with monolithic telecoms companies in the past who operate like this when they have huge legacy codebases and don’t want to let on that your job will primarily be maintenance, i.e. previous employees have lost the will to live and have literally drowned in unrepeatable error messages and the resultant unresolvable tickets. 

Don’t get me wrong, some people have to do maintenance and some people even love to do maintenance, but an employer should not try to hide the fact of what the role actually entails. More often than not if you employ someone through subterfuge they’ll either just leave or become more and more unhappy that they’ll just stop doing their job and eventually have to be forced out some other way by the employer. 

Always do try and find out why the role is available and if you can’t get a sensible straight answer or explanation then it might be time to move on.



### Switchup


An employer can advertise a role with a fun technology and get a lot of applicants, pick a well-meaning, eager, and even optimistic individual, but once they’re behind their desk they then pull a sneaky bait and switch. 

You turn up to do Swift but apparently some tenuously related legacy library codebase or something needs a little attention. Oh you don’t know Javascript? You’re a bright one, you’ve been around, all languages are pretty much the same and Javascript is simples, right?You’ll easily pick it up. It’s only temporary. Wow, you’re really good at that now, could you just look at this? And so it begins. 

Oh the times I’ve seen this one happen. The technology you’re employed for seems to get further and further away the more you approach it. And it’s so easy to be flattered into altering your own goalposts isn’t it? This is a lesson you learn when you become a little jaded through experience. Like me. That’s why I’m here, writing this, to help you. Honest. 

Be very, very wary about an interviewer when they become evasive about technologies. Perhaps they’re ‘evaluating’ the technology you’re interviewing for (and subsequently decide against it when you’ve signed on the dotted line and have a few weeks on the books) or they’re ‘looking into a rewrite’ (rewrites never happen, at least not coming from a management direction). 

To take a role you need commitment — on your side for sure, but also on the side of the interviewer who should commit to the role being offered being what it actually says on the tin. 

If they’re evasive on technology it’s most likely a lack of commitment. 

Note: I do understand that when recruiting for a project that some technologies may need to be evaluated but you don’t generally employ new staff in order to do that. Well, not permanent staff anyway. Contractors or outside third parties should be the go-to people not permanent staff as they can be taken on and dropped on a whim. I loved contracting, still do. 

This evasiveness can also come about through the reluctance of the available talent pool to work with a particular technology. I mentioned a simplistic bait and switch between Swift and Javascript but consider something a little more insidious. 

Perhaps you’re Linux (that’s UNIX to us old people) but they want you to work with their proprietary editor that only functions with their proprietary Eclipse plugin. You know Vim does the job, but they insist. It’s company policy. It’s company policy that they never told you about or avoided mentioning when you asked about specifics of the technologies involved. 

I remember a time when all HR functions, including bizarrely email, were only available through Lotus Domino at a particularly large multinational and it was a living nightmare similar to wading through corrosive hot treacle. 

More time was spent struggling with the ‘all-in-one’ mail, room booking, time management, scheduling, ‘tool’ than was ever spent coding. Similarly I’ve seen whole teams of developers brought to their knees by the enforcement of Rational Rose and Clearcase. 

Ask about technologies for design, development, and collaboration. Absolutely do not forget to ask about the edge cases!



The ‘conveyer belt’ approach to interviewing gets the interviewee in, grilled, and out of the door as quickly as possible without giving them a chance to ask any questions. Also known as the ‘rubber stamp’ process. 

Often this can indicate that there are a lot of candidates and/or that interviewing is such a regular occurrence that it has become more of a production line than an actually productive process. 

Either staff turnover is exceptionally high, the company is undergoing somewhat rapid expansion, or everyone is leaving and it’s all hands bailing out the water as fast as they can to try to keep the company afloat. 

Do some due diligence on this one — find out about employee numbers, how the market’s looking for the company, or even try to find someone in the know either at the company or in an agency for some insider information. 

The only case I’d consider a company where there’s little time for questions would be as a contractor. Even a well-funded startup should have time for questions, don’t let the money or share options blind you unless you’re willing to put up with whatever is thrown at you.





### Decoding the Unspoken: Insights into Evasive Interview Practices

**Evaluating the Mystery Behind Role Availability**

The interview room seems promising - engaging technical discussions, theoretical explorations, and a positive vibe. As the conversation flows, the interviewer opens the floor for your questions. Here lies a critical juncture. The air suddenly shifts, and the sunlit atmosphere darkens with a single query: "Do you have any specific questions about the role?"

For a software engineer, understanding why a position is available is vital. Is it a new role for an ambitious project, or has someone departed, creating a vacancy? The discerning candidate seizes this opportunity to unravel the layers behind the role's existence. A well-prepared interviewer will readily share insights, but when evasion or reluctance surfaces, it raises red flags.

Uncovering the truth behind the role's availability is a two-way street. Top-secret positions may limit discussion about technologies or team details, but in most cases, transparency is crucial. If the interviewer avoids the topic, it might signal past uncertainties or an unfillable role. Instances with monolithic companies concealing the maintenance-heavy nature of a position are cautionary tales. A genuine employer aligns role expectations with reality, fostering a healthy work environment.

**Beware of the Bait and Switch Tactics**

The bait and switch strategy, where an enticing technology lures candidates, only to be substituted with unrelated tasks, is an unfortunate reality. Swiftly transitioning from your preferred tech stack to an unexpected legacy codebase becomes a common narrative. The initial promise of temporary detours often evolves into persistent diversions, leaving you grappling with unforeseen technologies.

Vigilance is key. An interviewer's evasiveness about technologies could indicate a lack of commitment to the advertised role. Ambiguous mentions of technology evaluations or hypothetical rewrites may leave you stranded in a tech landscape far removed from your expectations. Commitment from both sides is crucial for a successful work relationship.

**The Conveyor Belt Interview Trap**

The conveyor belt approach, characterized by swift, question-heavy interviews, might be a subtle warning. If your interview feels like a rubber stamp process, pushing candidates in and out without allowing meaningful interactions, it raises concerns. This scenario may suggest a high turnover, rapid company expansion, or an exodus-like situation.

Due diligence is your ally. Investigate employee numbers, market perceptions, or tap into insider information through company contacts or agencies. While contractors may endure faster-paced interviews, even a well-funded startup should afford candidates the chance to inquire. Don't let tempting financial offers blind you; the ability to ask questions is your right, essential for making informed career choices.
