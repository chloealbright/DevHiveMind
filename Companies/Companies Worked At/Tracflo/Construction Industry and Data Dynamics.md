In the construction industry, a complex network of relationships exists among various entities, shaping the flow of data and responsibilities. Here's an overview of the hierarchical structure and the role data plays in this ecosystem:

1. **Company Hierarchy:**
   - Construction companies often hire General Contractors (GC) to oversee and manage construction projects.

2. **Role of General Contractors:**
   - General Contractors play a pivotal role in project management, organizing jobsites, and overseeing the construction schedule.
   - They are responsible for hiring subcontractors, managing their quality, contracting suppliers and vendors, and arranging equipment.

3. **Subcontractors and Specializations:**
   - Subcontractors, which can include plumbers, carpenters, electricians, HVAC specialists, etc., are hired by General Contractors.
   - Subcontractors are typically companies with multiple crew members, each specializing in a specific trade.

4. **Budgeting and Adjustments:**
   - Each subcontractor operates within a predefined budget for their assigned tasks.
   - Subcontractors may adjust their budgets if they foresee potential overruns, leading to approval reviews and negotiations.

5. **Change Orders and Tickets:**
   - Change orders, often documented through line-item tickets, represent alterations to the original construction contract. These changes impact the contractor's scope of work.

6. **General Contractor Responsibilities:**
   - General Contractors have diverse responsibilities, including cleanup, enforcing safety procedures, and managing demolition when necessary.
   - Their overarching responsibilities also encompass licensing, renting equipment, providing field management, and coordinating labor.

7. **Proposal Submission:**
   - General Contractors typically submit detailed bids or project proposals to secure construction projects.
   - Creating these proposals involves meticulous effort, requiring quantity and material takeoff from project specifications to generate precise cost estimates.

8. **Estimation Considerations:**
   - Cost estimates for project proposals encompass various factors, such as materials, equipment rental, labor, insurance expenses, worker's compensation, and time.
   - Proposals are essential for clients to assess the feasibility and costs associated with a construction project.

9. **Change Order Dynamics:**
   - A change order, an industry term, refers to an amendment in the construction contract that modifies the contractor's scope of work.
   - These modifications can range from minor adjustments to substantial additions aimed at improving the overall project.

Understanding the intricacies of data flow and responsibilities within the construction industry is crucial for efficient project management. The coordination between companies, general contractors, subcontractors, and the implementation of change orders reflects the dynamic nature of construction projects.
