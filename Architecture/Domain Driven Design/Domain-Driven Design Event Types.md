There are typically two main types of events in DDD:

- **Domain Events**: These events capture changes in the domain and are raised by the domain logic. For example, "OrderPlaced" or "CustomerRegistered" could be domain events.
- **Integration Events**: These events are used to communicate between different parts of a distributed system. They help maintain consistency between different bounded contexts within a system.


1. **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**: DDD often employs an event-driven architecture where components of a system communicate by producing and consuming events. This allows for loose coupling between different parts of the system.
    
2. **Event Sourcing**: In some cases, events are stored as the primary source of truth about the state of the system. This approach, known as event sourcing, involves persisting the series of events that led to the current state, rather than storing the current state itself.
    
3. **Event Handlers**: Components in the system react to events by having associated event handlers. These handlers update the system's state or trigger additional processes based on the received events.
    

In summary, events in Domain-Driven Design serve as a means of capturing and communicating changes in the system, promoting a more flexible and decoupled architecture. They play a crucial role in modeling the behavior and evolution of a system within its business context.
