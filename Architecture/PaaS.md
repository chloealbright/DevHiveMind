Being the middle child of autonomy and control, [PaaS is a cloud computing model](https://www.artifakt.com/paas-advantages-disadvantages-and-cost/) that provides developers with a platform to develop, deploy, and run applications. Its main goal is rapid development and that’s the reason why it aims to eliminate the costs and complexity that come with configuring, deploying, and managing the required infrastructure.  

### PaaS characteristics 

All PaaS technologies are following the shared responsibility model, which is the only common characteristic between PaaS and other models. A PaaS platform is responsible for: 

-   providing an infrastructure—servers, network, storage 
    
-   bootstrapping and deploying servers—install and configure OS, install the desired runtime, as well as install security patches and keep them up to date. 
    
-   providing middleware services—database, messaging service, cache storage, etc. The types of middleware provided always depend on the choice of PaaS and its implementation. 
    

### PaaS advantages 

PaaS has [many advantages](https://www.artifakt.com/paas-advantages-disadvantages-and-cost/) but to sum it up:  

-   it offers the right level of abstraction for developers 
    
-   it is a pay-as-you-go service 
    
-   it is built on shared good practices 
    

### PaaS disadvantages 

There are plenty of narratives picturing this model as a technology that has reached its peak of effectiveness while others, rightfully so, point to [a few disadvantages](https://www.artifakt.com/paas-advantages-disadvantages-and-cost/) that come with using this model. 

-   **One size does not fit all**. With an ever-expanding IT landscape, a PaaS solution is bound to select the most relevant stack of components and build a consistent offer with their best level of integration, security, and support. That means leaving a whole range of projects out of its scope. 
    
-   **Vendor lock**-in. You must be very careful when auditing and choosing a vendor. Whether the vendor you chose runs out of business or no longer serves the needs of your organization, a migration can impose significant costs and in-house engineering work. 
    
-   **Financial viability**. Management can not always have full visibility over the resources their engineers are using.  
    

### Platform as a Service 

-   Definitely, the best option when you need to develop and deploy applications fast while having multiple developers working on the same project.  
    
-   If you are on a tight budget, PaaS solutions can be very cost-effective compared to hiring an entire DevOps team.  
    
-   Sitting between IaaS and SaaS, PaaS offers a satisfying level of customization, making it a great choice for those who want to customize certain aspects of their applications but not go in too deep.
