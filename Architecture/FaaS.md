**AWS Lambda vs FaaS: What are the differences?**

**What is AWS Lambda?** _Automatically run code in response to modifications to objects in Amazon S3 buckets, messages in Kinesis streams, or updates in DynamoDB_. AWS Lambda is a compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. You can use AWS Lambda to extend other AWS services with custom logic, or create your own back-end services that operate at AWS scale, performance, and security.

**What is FaaS?** _Functions as a Service (on Docker Swarm)_. FaaS is a platform for building serverless functions on Docker Swarm Mode with first class metrics. Any UNIX process can be packaged as a function in FaaS enabling you to consume a range of web events without repetitive boiler-plate coding.

AWS Lambda and FaaS can be primarily classified as **"Serverless / Task Processing"** tools.
