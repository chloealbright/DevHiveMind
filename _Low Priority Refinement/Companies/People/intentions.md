Ask questions about things you already know or obvious to you to see what advice someone gives you and what their intentions are


## Cold call
- Cold call the company to ask him about the schedule interview that is not actually there to get an interview

## Looking busy
- Elongate statistics so if you're talking about doing something for a year instead of saying 1 year say over 12 months
