## Sprint Shirt Size Guidelines

When determining the sprint size for a story, consider the following guidelines:

- **XS (Extra Small):** Estimated completion in less than 1 sprint or 2 weeks. Assess whether the task is better suited as a story rather than an epic.

- **S (Small):** Expected completion in 1 to 2 sprints, approximately a month.

- **M (Medium):** Completion expected in 2 to 4 sprints or 1 to 2 months.

- **L (Large):** Targeted completion in 4 to 5 sprints or 2 to 3 months.

- **XL or XXL (Extra Large):** Estimated completion in more than 5 to 6 sprints; consider breaking it into 2 separate epics.
