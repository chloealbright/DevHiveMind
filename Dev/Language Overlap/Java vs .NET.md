release - deploy for user

chapter 2

Data types

    Decimal = double in java

Double vs float

double has more bits, need a lot of numbers

float will truncate

COMPILER OPTIONs (what is defaulted on and off)

Option Explicit - z = 6 (automatically says z is an int) when turned on you cannot do this

chapter 5

Passby Value - passes value - Java

Passby reference (ByRef) - Passes address- .NET cannot be done in java

chapter 8

Dim NameString(25) As String  -- 0 up to 25 included ...25 is the highest subscript...length is 26

ReDim - Redimension a size of an array

disadvantage in VB...java more flexible in 2D arrays

In Java each of the array may be different size in java when using 2D arrays

in VB the different sizes are there but you need 0s to fill in the blank areas
