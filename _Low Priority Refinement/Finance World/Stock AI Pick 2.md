ChatGPT Plus is out at $20 per month.  
  
Let's guess their annual revenue with a 5-step calculation.  
  
1. Number of free users  
  
In January 2023, based on estimations, ChatGPT has around 100 000 000 free users.  
  
That's a 100M people potential client base.  
  
Let's imagine they make the plus version available to their worldwide database;  
  
  
2. Freemium to Premium  
  
Here is a quick benchmark of freemium to premium conversion rate;  
  
- Spotify : 27%  
- Evernote: 4.1%  
- Dropbox: 4%  
- Google drive: 0.5%  
  
But typically, the freemium conversion rate is around 1-5%.  
  
  
3. Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)  
  
100M x 1% = 1 000 000  
  
1 000 000 x $20= $20 000 000  
  
That's a potential $20M MRR starting from the first month.  
  
  
4. Potential Annual recurring revenue (ARR)  
  
$20M x 12 = $240M  
  
That's a potential ARR of $240M per year.  
  
For the first year.  
  
  
5. Churn rate  
  
Some users will stop using the plus version.  
  
The average annual churn rate for a SAAS company is 3-8%  
  
Let's take the highest monthly churn rate: 8%  
  
Why? Hypothesis: Because many users will try just for the hype in the first year.  
  
  
6. Annual recurring revenue (ARR)  
  
I will do a rough calculation and take out 8% of the yearly sales volume.  
  
(That might not be an excellent way to do it but this post is getting too long)  
  
$240M - 8% = 220 800 000  
  
***  
  
That's a great example of the combination of 3 powerful tactics:  
  
- Freemium model  
- Product-led growth  
- Community-led growth  
  
Probably the first example ever of this scale.  
  
But don't forget the project started in 2015. They worked in the dark for 7 years.  
  
PS: I made this simple calculation based on data available on the web. There is a high chance that it will be different as reality is way more complex. Only time will tell us.  
  
We would also need an expert to review the calculations (especially on parts 5-6). Some people said in the comments we should ask ChatGPT, that makes sense!
