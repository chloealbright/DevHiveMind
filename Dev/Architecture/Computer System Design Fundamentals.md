A distributed system is defined as “An interconnected set of nodes that are linked by a network and share information between them.” Although a distributed system consists of multiple components, it serves a single purpose to the system’s user. Some examples of distributed systems in computer science are the backends of Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. Systems like the Internet, Blockchain, or even the human nervous system is a distributed system.
