### Evasiveness about why the role exists 

The interview seems to be going well. You have a well-constructed chair, a drink, and the sun isn’t shining directly into your eyes through a slatted blind behind the interviewer’s head. Technical questions go well, there’s no coding test just a general theoretical discussion on the merits of different approaches to problem solving and the pragmatism of development methodologies. 

You start to smile inside, get the nice warm fuzzy feeling, then the interviewer asks if you have any specific questions about the role. 

The sky suddenly turns ominously dark outside. 

I’m always interested, as a software engineer not personally, why a role I’m interviewing for has become available — whether it’s new or become vacant. 

Sometimes it’s a new one for a specific project and the present team lacks the technical ability so needs someone who has it or they need to expand the number of people to cater for a higher work load. Other times it’s because someone on the team has left the company and it’s in this case where I try to dig a little deeper if I can. 

Remember you’re interviewing them as much as they’re interviewing you. 

Often enough a well versed human interviewer will happily discuss why the role has become available but a red flag starts its long way way up the pole if they become evasive or flat out refuse to discuss it. 

It’s not often you’re interviewing for top secret roles, though they do happen, and discussion of the technologies and sometimes the team are completely verboten. But, generally, if the interviewer avoids the reason then I tend to assume that it’s because the previous incumbent left on uncertain terms or that the role, if discussed, is unfillable — i.e. they can’t find someone to take it once they know why it’s free. 

I’ve interviewed for roles with monolithic telecoms companies in the past who operate like this when they have huge legacy codebases and don’t want to let on that your job will primarily be maintenance, i.e. previous employees have lost the will to live and have literally drowned in unrepeatable error messages and the resultant unresolvable tickets. 

Don’t get me wrong, some people have to do maintenance and some people even love to do maintenance, but an employer should not try to hide the fact of what the role actually entails. More often than not if you employ someone through subterfuge they’ll either just leave or become more and more unhappy that they’ll just stop doing their job and eventually have to be forced out some other way by the employer. 

Always do try and find out why the role is available and if you can’t get a sensible straight answer or explanation then it might be time to move on.



### Switchup


An employer can advertise a role with a fun technology and get a lot of applicants, pick a well-meaning, eager, and even optimistic individual, but once they’re behind their desk they then pull a sneaky bait and switch. 

You turn up to do Swift but apparently some tenuously related legacy library codebase or something needs a little attention. Oh you don’t know Javascript? You’re a bright one, you’ve been around, all languages are pretty much the same and Javascript is simples, right?You’ll easily pick it up. It’s only temporary. Wow, you’re really good at that now, could you just look at this? And so it begins. 

Oh the times I’ve seen this one happen. The technology you’re employed for seems to get further and further away the more you approach it. And it’s so easy to be flattered into altering your own goalposts isn’t it? This is a lesson you learn when you become a little jaded through experience. Like me. That’s why I’m here, writing this, to help you. Honest. 

Be very, very wary about an interviewer when they become evasive about technologies. Perhaps they’re ‘evaluating’ the technology you’re interviewing for (and subsequently decide against it when you’ve signed on the dotted line and have a few weeks on the books) or they’re ‘looking into a rewrite’ (rewrites never happen, at least not coming from a management direction). 

To take a role you need commitment — on your side for sure, but also on the side of the interviewer who should commit to the role being offered being what it actually says on the tin. 

If they’re evasive on technology it’s most likely a lack of commitment. 

Note: I do understand that when recruiting for a project that some technologies may need to be evaluated but you don’t generally employ new staff in order to do that. Well, not permanent staff anyway. Contractors or outside third parties should be the go-to people not permanent staff as they can be taken on and dropped on a whim. I loved contracting, still do. 

This evasiveness can also come about through the reluctance of the available talent pool to work with a particular technology. I mentioned a simplistic bait and switch between Swift and Javascript but consider something a little more insidious. 

Perhaps you’re Linux (that’s UNIX to us old people) but they want you to work with their proprietary editor that only functions with their proprietary Eclipse plugin. You know Vim does the job, but they insist. It’s company policy. It’s company policy that they never told you about or avoided mentioning when you asked about specifics of the technologies involved. 

I remember a time when all HR functions, including bizarrely email, were only available through Lotus Domino at a particularly large multinational and it was a living nightmare similar to wading through corrosive hot treacle. 

More time was spent struggling with the ‘all-in-one’ mail, room booking, time management, scheduling, ‘tool’ than was ever spent coding. Similarly I’ve seen whole teams of developers brought to their knees by the enforcement of Rational Rose and Clearcase. 

Ask about technologies for design, development, and collaboration. Absolutely do not forget to ask about the edge cases!



The ‘conveyer belt’ approach to interviewing gets the interviewee in, grilled, and out of the door as quickly as possible without giving them a chance to ask any questions. Also known as the ‘rubber stamp’ process. 

Often this can indicate that there are a lot of candidates and/or that interviewing is such a regular occurrence that it has become more of a production line than an actually productive process. 

Either staff turnover is exceptionally high, the company is undergoing somewhat rapid expansion, or everyone is leaving and it’s all hands bailing out the water as fast as they can to try to keep the company afloat. 

Do some due diligence on this one — find out about employee numbers, how the market’s looking for the company, or even try to find someone in the know either at the company or in an agency for some insider information. 

The only case I’d consider a company where there’s little time for questions would be as a contractor. Even a well-funded startup should have time for questions, don’t let the money or share options blind you unless you’re willing to put up with whatever is thrown at you.
