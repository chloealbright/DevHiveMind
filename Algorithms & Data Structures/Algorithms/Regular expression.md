The runtime of functions that take in regular expression (regex) strings can vary based on factors such as the complexity of the regex pattern, the size of the input data, and the efficiency of the regex engine used by the programming language or library.  
  
In general, simple and well-optimized regex patterns tend to have faster runtimes, while complex or inefficient patterns may take longer to execute. Additionally, the length and structure of the input data play a role in the overall performance.  
  
It's important to consider the specific implementation details of the regex engine being used, as different programming languages and libraries may employ different strategies for regex matching. If performance is a critical concern, profiling and testing with representative data sets can help identify potential bottlenecks and optimize the regex usage.
