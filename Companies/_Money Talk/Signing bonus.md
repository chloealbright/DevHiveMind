Ask if there are any bonuses then flip it on them and say base pay isn't in the range that I was looking for but in terms of the bonus I feel like that would go a long way  
  
Especially since there's inflation coming soon so I'm kind of a little worried in terms of the cost of living trying to take into consideration so it doesn't become an issue down the line and I don't want to be in a position where salary is a thing that I need to consider  
  
tell them I,m only looking for what is fair for some one of my position and experience and avoid talking to much  
  
bringing up other offers from companies and talk about the reason you want to work at their company and can they match the offer of the other company  
  
The email you tell them this a lot of good information is it okay if I spend some time to go over this and get back to you will that be okay  
  
  
annual bonus are usually during holiday time so if going to new company ask about signing bonus  
  
tell them when you got a bonus or you were expecting one from last company so the signing bonus can be added to the negotiation conversation  
  
focus more on the salary  
  
also if market is good like now focus on the bonus a little  
  
also relocation can be considered a signing bonus  
  
Retention Bonus getting a bonus after a year(like a back-end bonus) or something this move gives you a lot of credibility and starts you off on a good foot for future negotiations and letting them know you want to be there for a while  
  
but be careful about this because a company can go under or other outside things can happen so always go for higher salary
