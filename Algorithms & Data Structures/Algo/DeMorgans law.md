De Morgan's Law of Union, often referred to as De Morgan's Law, is a fundamental principle in set theory. It states that the complement of the union of two sets, A and B, is equal to the intersection of the complements of A and B. This law can be expressed as `(A ∪ B)' = A' ∩ B'`. It serves as a key tool for manipulating sets and understanding their relationships.

Propositions are statements or assertions that express judgments or opinions. In a mathematical context, propositions are used to make claims, such as "3 is greater than 4," "an infinite set exists," or "7 is prime." Axioms are propositions that are assumed to be true, serving as the foundational building blocks for mathematical systems.

**Propositional Logic,** also known as sentential logic or statement logic, is a branch of logic that focuses on how to combine and modify entire propositions, statements, or sentences to create more complex ones. It delves into the logical relationships and properties that result from these operations. In propositional logic, the basic statements are considered indivisible units. Therefore, propositional logic does not analyze the logical properties and relationships that depend on the components of statements, such as subjects and predicates.

The most extensively studied branch of propositional logic is classical truth-functional propositional logic. This branch explores logical operators and connectives used to create complex statements whose truth-value is entirely determined by the truth-values of the simpler statements that compose them. In this context, it is assumed that every statement is either true or false but not both. However, there are other variations of propositional logic that consider different truth-values or connectives that factor in additional attributes like necessity, possibility, or relatedness among statements.
