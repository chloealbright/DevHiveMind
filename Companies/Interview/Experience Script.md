## TD Ameritrade - Business Systems Analyst 

**Refine

At TD in New York, I spearheaded the adoption of SAFe workflow, boosting organization-wide usage by 12%. In agile ceremonies, I collaborated with Product Owners, Scrum Masters, and Stakeholders, enhancing team productivity. Managing Jira for backlog refinement led to a 20% efficiency gain and a clear roadmap.

Utilizing PowerBI, I crafted logical data models for skill matrices, analyzing key metrics like velocity and cycle time. By conducting needs assessments and collaborating with stakeholders, I aligned upskilling initiatives with organizational goals, optimizing resource allocation.

Collaborating with a third-party upskilling firm, I facilitated an internal program, upskilling 200+ software engineers across 10 cohorts in Advanced Java, Spring Boot, Docker, Event-Driven Architecture, and Reactive Programming. This comprehensive effort spanned 5 months, fostering skill development from associates to senior developers. Lessons learned include strategic planning, efficient collaboration, and successful program execution.


## TracFlo  

I was employed at TracFlo, a fintech company operating within the construction industry with a primary objective to streamline construction projects by digitizing documentation and processes, specifically targeting the elimination of change orders. My role as a full stack developer involved contributing to various features on their new application.

One of my initial tasks was managing the data migration process from the old WordPress app to the new one. I created different migration files using the Knex.js query builder library, focusing on diverse data tables from the old app. This process also involved redefining table relationships to accommodate changes in business logic.

In addition, I worked on multiple endpoints using Typescript interfaces and types, implementing them on an Express server. On the frontend, I utilized React along with technologies such as Redux, React hooks, and props, incorporating libraries like MUI. Specific features included the development of CreateTickets and sub-features like Get all, Create, and Edit for equipment and materials. I also played a key role in defining field definitions for user and labor components and created integration tests for endpoints utilizing Mock Data.

## Under the wing Independent contract project 

I collaborated on a project for the Department of a small business, named Under the Wing, where our focus was an online mentorship platform. As a front-end developer within a team of three, we engaged in crucial project aspects such as defining scope, deliverables, and establishing a robust data model. Our approach followed agile development methodologies.

In terms of technology, I leveraged React, Bootstrap, and various other libraries to craft reusable components. Throughout the development process, I diligently adhered to sprint cycles, ensuring timely and iterative progress. Additionally, I contributed to comprehensive project documentation using Markdown.


## Park alert 

My favorite project, Park Alert, is a mobile application designed to assist users in finding parking spots. The concept draws inspiration from the Citizen app combined with the convenience of Uber. This endeavor challenged me to engage in thoughtful planning and strategic thinking. I created numerous UML diagrams to map out the system design and its various components.

During the development process, I constructed a mock application utilizing Dart, Flutter, and a map API. The extensive use of diagrams not only enhanced my understanding of the project but also sharpened my skills in whiteboard discussions and code debugging. This project served as a valuable learning experience, requiring me to delve into various technologies, grasp GitHub intricacies, work within a Linux development environment, and draw inspiration from diverse projects to refine my design approach.
