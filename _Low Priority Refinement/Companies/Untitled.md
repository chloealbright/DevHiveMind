   - Leverage numbers strategically, providing a range and being transparent when finalizing details.
   - Use phrases like "we are close" to indicate progress in negotiations without being overly pushy.

# Company Stability  

All else being equal, of course stability is a good thing. No one wants to be fired or laid off. However, all else isn't actually equal. The more stable companies are also often growing more slowly. How much emphasis you should put on company stability really depends on you and your values. For some candidates, stability should not be a large factor. Can you fairly quickly find a new job? If so, it might be better to take the rapidly growing company, even if it's unstable? If you have work visa restrictions or just aren't confident in your ability to find something new, stability might be more important.  

Ask about compensation band for the position. Comp bands are a simple framework for structuring total compensation on your team, and are simple to set up: For every role and level, establish a standard range of compensation (base, bonus, equity). Use comp bands to create offers, determine merit adjustments, and calibrate promotion  

Because the company has a range they're trying to stay under to operate  


# Performance 

Ask what would the performance review cycle look like  

Watch out for change in roles in a company because they may give you a performance review knowing that you're not use to the new role and the responsibilities  

If you can't get a 3% raise after a year and you like 2 years in aim for a 5% or 4% raise  

In order to fire you  

They might put you on a performance improvement plan without you no way in order to put you down the path of getting fired since you not experience the new roll essentially  

When negotiating I'm going back and forth with numbers when they go lower ask them how about you do this number then after 90 days if my performance is good you bump it up to this price  



1. **Contract Roles and Conversion Rate:**
   - Inquire about the conversion rate for contract roles to gain insights into potential long-term opportunities.
   - Always seek clarity on the percentage of contractors who transition to full-time positions within the company.

2. **Interaction with Recruiters:**
   - Request the recruiter's name and contact information to establish a direct line of communication.
   - Prepare for interviews by obtaining the hiring manager's email and engaging in direct discussions with them.

3. **Navigating Recruiter Relationships:**
   - Apply directly to the company after obtaining necessary information from the recruiter.
   - Be mindful of the recruiter's role in the hiring process, as they receive a cut of your salary, and decide on further interactions based on your career interests.

4. **Preference for Direct Hire:**
   - Prioritize applying directly to the hiring company rather than through a third-party recruiter.
   - Consider going for direct hires to streamline communication and potentially negotiate terms more effectively.
