Ask if roll is direct hire or contract  

Define expectations  

Ask about current performance and are you on track towards your annual performance review  

reach to people from different people in different industry  

strategies how you would keep connected with people in your network  

look into a recommendation from from Tracflo  

profile stats on StackOverflow are good to use for job application  

Applying at smaller companies like startups, with revenues between $5 million to $50 million, increases your chances of being invited to an interview Mondays are the best days to apply  

Always apply you don't have to respond as long as you have the email she could respond in the future just to make sure you have connections to other companies to apply for even while you're working  

Netflix won't be given algorithms questions for front end  

Exit interviews can be bait for ammo for the company if they want to come after you for something  


# Startup question to ask  

	Do your research on companies before joining  
	
	Ask for numbers  
	
	Talk with people who left  
	
	Do you have clear business metrics that you are track and do engineers have access to this info  
	
	Ask to talk to lead investors  

Roles - reach out to a company telling them that you know you aren't ready but how can you improve  

# Site reliability Engineer  
will this role be proactive or more reactive just in terms of responsibilities reactive being helping someone or something proactive being improving something for better reliability  
 
# Red flag  
	
	If you talk to your manager and ask them what can you do to do to get a higher position and they give you a BS answer that's a red flag s*** definitely think about working with someone else or doing something else in the company  
	
	A company asked you about side hustles or things to do outside don't tell them anything but also that's a red flag that they're going to give you overtime  
	
	If asked about previous salary tell them you don't feel comfortable giving your previous salary and I don't understand why the number matters because you gave me test to evaluate my skill set based on your own criteria not the last company criteria also I know like within like certain States that's not allowed so I don't want to break the law or put you in a position where you're breaking the law  
	
	Try to change teams within a year or less to grow more and understand the company  
	Make Sure responsibilities align with job description  

# Performance 

	Ask what would the performance review cycle look like  
	
	Watch out for change in roles in a company because they may give you a performance review knowing that you're not use to the new role and the responsibilities  
	
	If you can't get a 3% raise after a year and you like 2 years in aim for a 5% or 4% raise  
	
	In order to fire you  
	
	They might put you on a performance improvement plan without you no way in order to put you down the path of getting fired since you not experience the new roll essentially  
	
	When negotiating I'm going back and forth with numbers when they go lower ask them how about you do this number then after 90 days if my performance is good you bump it up to this price  

# Company Stability  

All else being equal, of course stability is a good thing. No one wants to be fired or laid off. However, all else isn't actually equal. The more stable companies are also often growing more slowly. How much emphasis you should put on company stability really depends on you and your values. For some candidates, stability should not be a large factor. Can you fairly quickly find a new job? If so, it might be better to take the rapidly growing company, even if it's unstable? If you have work visa restrictions or just aren't confident in your ability to find something new, stability might be more important.  

Ask about compensation band for the position. Comp bands are a simple framework for structuring total compensation on your team, and are simple to set up: For every role and level, establish a standard range of compensation (base, bonus, equity). Use comp bands to create offers, determine merit adjustments, and calibrate promotion  

Because the company has a range they're trying to stay under to operate  

If you're in New York you should be in the 90 to 200k range since in a major city for total compensation  

if going to go to new-company you can potentially get a 10 to 15% more  


# Technical Debt & Hiring Manager  

So what is toil? Toil is the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and that scales linearly as a service grows.  

For technical debt, I usually ask about how they handle fires and developer toil.  

It’s a good sign if the manager is actively involved in reducing developer toil and is throwing lots of people toward paying down certain debt.  

For the time-off portion, I ask how many weeks do people take off or I say something like “I like to travel” and see their response.  

A manager that encourages people to take time off is also more likely to put their developers first when it comes to burnout / deadlines.  

Manager approval for time off can be a red flag at “unlimted PTO” companies because they can just stop you from taking PTO at all.  

But that is very hard to avoid if the company is “unlimited PTO”.  

I’ve seen some managers give some bad responses when it comes to rewarding good engineers.  

Good engineers often don’t stay long but if good engineers are constantly leaving (especially at the same time) it can hurt morale.  


# Topics to reference in resume  

Talk about APIs runtime complexity and other advanced programming terms in your resume  
Debugging  

Unit testing  

Avoid using "a" in resume  

creating technical resume statistic  

15 min 10 user = 40 user per hour * 24 * 365 = 350.4

# ToDo  
Ask for conversion rate for a contract roles and always get a percentage  

Always try to get company name from recruiters tell them that you need their name prepare properly for the interview or hiring managers email and talk to them directly  

Then apply to the company and ghost recruiter because they getting a cut out of your salary  

Always try to go direct higher as opposed to the recruiter firm who are third-party

# Being remembered  
	schedule one on ones with a boss or reach out once a month or every two weeks 

# LinkedIn  
don't ask a detailed question upfront  

Study Recruiters pg don't ask for anything If your connecting without any prior meeting mention how you haven't met and how you found them compliment things they did or posted or mention commonalities ask about how they started at the company there path try or try connecting someone to another person in your network or outside your network. just personal messages be brief mention their time being taken. build a repor comment on their post mentioned previous comments  

follow up on job post by thanking them for a connection first and mentioning job post telling that how you good for the role but also mentioning how they probably have a lot of applicants then ask a question about what is the most important thing about when they are considering a candidate for the position I would really like your feedback and insight so I can better prepare myself for more to someday earn the opportunity to interview with you.  

ask another question after doing research on connections made on LinkedIn try to find common interests or ask about there interest or offer them something  

if you join the group on Linkedin you can message anyone in that group  

reach out to multiple people in the group also if you scroll all the way down to interest and click view all you can see what groups someone is in to try to join that group or multiple groups so you can message them without connecting  

Add keywords from the job description to resume and profile because LinkedIn uses boolean string on the backend with the job description to find people  

Update LinkedIn profile every week it alerts recruiters who follow you  

Find people at the company to connect with to get potential referrals  
It's not the 10 companies you focus on and research and Network be more targeted  

Look into writing your own medium article  

Email and network more  

Some employees get bonuses for referring people

# Networking & at job  
schedule one on ones with a boss or reach out once a month or every two weeks  


# Conversation intro  
Haitian American college major stuff software stuff interest about there company  

Use language of job description  


# Saying no  
You can leave an interview by telling them you are not the right candidate for this role but I would like to think you for your time  

Be aware of the timeline especially if they ask for a commitment  

Mention you don’t want to waste time  

When negotiating always think about thinking time and the task at hand on what you're being paid for to do like my side job and ask them I'm pretty full right now when would be a better time to to talk  

When asked to do something say I don't know if I'm the right person to do this maybe you should check with this person  

This is a really great idea but reason ...  

Or change time  


Keep things vague when talking about other companies in the process or stage your in  

Get understanding of the position and reschedule if needed to do more research  

If asked early in the process about compensation tell them that honestly I've been preparing for the interview so I haven't given a lot of thought could you kind of walk over the compensation structure and some of the perks and benefits so I can get a better idea of things  

Negotiation can start on the first call depending how far you are in the interview process always ask What is the next step in the hiring process? When can I expect to hear back from you? What is your timeline for filling this role ? if they give you a time frame and don't respond contact them  

Think about the math of your number like estimate or look for how many employees they have and come up with a general salary for them and add that all together to see how much it totals and try to get your number to around the range if that's what you're looking for in that range  

Provide timeline on other offers and interviews To give an expectation if they give you less time ask them when do you need an answer if you have other offers your wafting on tell them it is too short can we meet in the middle and i give you an answer at this time because I you don't want to turn down other opportunities without understanding what's in front of me  

So With that in mind Do you think we can be more flexible with the time and find something a little more longer I can try to talk to the other companies to see if I can expedite things a little more quicker 

Also don't forget to reinforce multiple times that you are interested to work at the company

Tell the company that you appreciate the offer and meeting them and that you consider your top choices however I'm speaking with other companies and make a decision I can commit to in order to make the right decision for me and my family and myself at this point in my career So I need some time to assess things but I'll keep you in the loop  

Do this on the phone  

Also the bigger the company the more time you might have on the timeline  

If they tell you that they have multiple candidates ask them how many positions they're looking to fill get as much info  

When it comes to them asking you your number again tell them that you're not comfortable with giving out that information nothing is finalized and say you understand my expectations that you laid out before at the beginning of the negotiation and say I just want to see what we can do  


And reiterate your range You mentioned if they tried to get you down again  

When it comes to leveraging numbers of other companies against each other  

Tell them let's see what we could do I'm flexible on the right offer  

I'm happy to be more transparent when things are more finalized from the other companies  


Avoid situations where you're waiting on numbers from other companies where is this giant loop of companies waiting on each other's numbers tell them that you've been in the situation before where this has been the case and I'm very interested in the value you see me and so um I want to see what you produce and once we have that and I'm happy to have a deeper conversation otherwise if not if you're not willing to give numbers till we get other numbers then I don't know if this is going to work  

Lead with carrot not stick meaning for example if you're talking with the company you could say I'm willing to start today or whenever if we could get to this number by the end of the day almost have a car salesman but you better be prepared to follow up if you do something like this  

Let the company know that you are close to coming to a agreement with them we just need to do a and b and we do right there we're very close using the word close is important because it creates a psychological need to get there without being too pushy or urgent  

Never tell a company that you got accepted or declined from a other company during negotiations or that couldn't come to an agreement  

Never lie about other numbers they might ask for proof  

When you can't get to the number dial back to a slightly lower number
