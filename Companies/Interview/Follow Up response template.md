I hope you don't mind me reaching out, as I applied to the JobTitlePosition role listed on your company website.

I know the company's goal is to acquire more customers globally, and with the rise of other competitors entering the market, the company needs to create innovative features and products. I d love to showcase how my skills and aid in the growth and further development of your company and it,s products. please let me know if I can provide any additional information to my application.  
  
All the best,
