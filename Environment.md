1. Development Environment: This environment is used by developers during the software development process. It typically includes local development machines or development servers where code changes are frequently tested and validated before being pushed to other environments.

2. Staging Environment: The staging environment serves as a pre-production environment where the application undergoes comprehensive testing before deployment to the production environment. It closely resembles the production environment in terms of configuration, infrastructure, and dependencies.

3. Production Environment: The production environment is the live or public-facing environment where the application serves real users or customers. It requires a high level of stability, scalability, and performance to handle the production workload. Security measures, monitoring systems, and disaster recovery mechanisms are crucial components of the production environment.

4. Testing Environment: A dedicated testing environment is used for conducting various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, and regression testing. It allows developers and testers to verify the application's functionality, compatibility, and performance in a controlled environment.

5. Quality Assurance (QA) Environment: The QA environment is specifically designed for the quality assurance team to perform extensive testing, including user acceptance testing (UAT), performance testing, and load testing. It helps ensure that the application meets the required quality standards before being deployed to production.

6. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Environment: This environment is primarily used for automated build, integration, and deployment processes. It involves the use of continuous integration and continuous deployment tools that automatically build, test, and deploy the application as changes are made to the codebase.

7. Disaster Recovery (DR) Environment: The DR environment serves as a backup or failover environment in case of a disaster or service interruption in the production environment. It replicates the production environment's infrastructure, data, and configurations to ensure business continuity and minimize downtime.

8. Cloud Environment: Cloud environments, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP), offer infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) or platform-as-a-service (PaaS) capabilities. These environments provide scalable, on-demand resources for deploying and managing applications in a cloud-based infrastructure.

9. On-Premises Environment: In contrast to cloud environments, on-premises environments involve deploying and managing applications on local infrastructure within an organization's data center. This environment provides direct control over hardware, network, and security but requires maintenance and scalability considerations.

It's important to note that the specific deployment environments can vary based on the organization, project, and technology stack being used. The above list represents common examples, but the deployment environments can be tailored to fit the unique needs and requirements of each application.
