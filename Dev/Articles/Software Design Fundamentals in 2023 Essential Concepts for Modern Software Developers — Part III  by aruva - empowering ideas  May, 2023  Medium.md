containerization and virtualization

## 11.1 Virtual Machines

Virtual machines (VMs) are emulated environments that run on a physical host. They provide isolation between applications and allow for more efficient resource usage.

_Virtual Machine creation using VBoxManage_

```
VBoxManage createvm --name "My_VM" --ostype "Ubuntu_64" --register  
VBoxManage modifyvm "My_VM" --memory 2048 --cpus 2 --vrde on  
VBoxManage createhd --filename "My_VM.vdi" --size 20000  
VBoxManage storagectl "My_VM" --name "SATA Controller" --add sata  
VBoxManage storageattach "My_VM" --storagectl "SATA Controller" --port 0 --device 0 --type hdd --medium "My_VM.vdi"  
VBoxManage storageattach "My_VM" --storagectl "SATA Controller" --port 1 --device 0 --type dvddrive --medium "/path/to/iso/ubuntu-20.04.3-live-server-amd64.iso"  
VBoxManage modifyvm "My_VM" --boot1 dvd  
VBoxHeadless --startvm "My_VM"

```

## 11.2 Containers

Containers are lightweight, isolated environments for running applications and their dependencies. They provide faster startup times and better resource utilization compared to VMs.

```
FROM python:3.9  
  
WORKDIR /app  
  
COPY requirements.txt .  
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt  
  
COPY . .  
  
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

## 11.3 Docker

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping and running applications in containers. It simplifies container creation, management, and deployment.

## 11.4 Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an orchestration platform for managing containerized applications at scale. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

```
apiVersion: apps/v1  
kind: Deployment

IaaS, PaaS and SaaS

## 12.1 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking. Users can provision and manage resources according to their needs.

## 12.2 Platform as a Service (PaaS)

PaaS provides a platform for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. It includes tools and services like runtime environments, databases, and development frameworks.

## 12.3 Software as a Service (SaaS)

SaaS provides software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users access the software through a web browser without needing to install or maintain the application.

## 13\. Authentication and Authorization

Authentication and authorization are essential for securing applications and ensuring that users can only access the resources they are permitted to.

## 13.1 Basic Authentication

Basic Authentication is a simple authentication scheme that requires users to provide a username and password. The credentials are sent as a Base64-encoded string in the HTTP header.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*soUwGe2cyxPZXuY8H6MSeA.png)

Basic Authentication

Implementing Basic Authentication in a Node.js Express App

```javascript
const express = require('express');  
const app = express();  
const basicAuth = require('express-basic-auth');  
  
app.use(basicAuth({  
  users: { 'username': 'password' },  
  challenge: true  
}));  
  
app.get('/', (req, res) => {  
  res.send('Hello, authenticated user!');  
});  
  
app.listen(3000, () => {  
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');  
});

```

## 13.2 OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that allows third-party applications to obtain limited access to a userâ€™s resources on another service without sharing their credentials. It uses access tokens to grant permissions.

JWT

Building JWT tokens in Node.js

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');  
const secret = 'your-secret-key';  
  
// Generating a JWT  
const payload = {  
  userId: '123',  
  role: 'user'  
};  
const token = jwt.sign(payload, secret, { expiresIn: '1h' });  
  
console.log('Generated JWT:', token);
```

## 14\. Web Application Security

Securing web applications is crucial to protect user data and maintain the integrity of the application.

## 14.1 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

XSS is a security vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious scripts into a web application, which can lead to unauthorized access or data theft.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*ituSJJL47sDHHXh18ii02g.png)

XSS

## 14.2 SQL Injection

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*TGT5F-UeIA7Vd7th9Fv9WQ.png)

SQL Injection

## 14.3 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

CSRF is a security vulnerability where an attacker tricks a user into performing actions on a web application without their knowledge, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data leaks.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*P17TYQW6HSFu-JgDsNC0Yw.png)

CSRF

## 14.4 HTTPS and SSL/TLS

HTTPS is a secure version of the HTTP protocol that encrypts communication between the client and the server using SSL/TLS. It helps protect data from eavesdropping and tampering during transmission.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*MtJ13SOmR1BkV4jeJ0OXpQ.png)

HTTPS and SSL/TLS

> **_Steps of Communication_**
> 
> The `Client` initiates the SSL/TLS handshake by sending a "Client Hello" message to the `Server`. This message contains the client's SSL/TLS version, cipher settings, and a random byte string.
> 
> The `Server` responds with a "Server Hello" message, which includes its own SSL/TLS version, cipher settings, random byte string, and certificate. The certificate contains the server's public key.
> 
> The `Client` generates a pre-master secret, encrypts it with the server's public key, and sends it to the `Server`.
> 
> The `Server` decrypts the pre-master secret using its private key.
> 
> Both the `Client` and the `Server` generate a session key, which is used to encrypt and decrypt all subsequent communications during the session. The session key is generated using the pre-master secret and the random byte strings exchanged in the "Hello" messages.
> 
> The `Client` sends a "Finished" message to the `Server`, encrypted with the session key. The `Server` does the same. This marks the end of the SSL/TLS handshake, and encrypted communication can now begin.

## 15\. Performance Optimization

Optimizing web application performance is crucial for providing a fast, responsive user experience.

## 15.1 Caching

Caching involves storing a copy of data or resources to reduce the time required to access them. It can significantly improve performance by reducing latency and server load.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*GvPN7TPWXQNhJdWZLXEX1g.png)

caching mechanism

_Code example_: Implementing server-side caching using Redis in a Node.js application

```javascript
const express = require('express');  
const redis = require('redis');  
const fetch = require('node-fetch');  
  
const app = express();  
const client = redis.createClient();  
  
function setResponse(username, repos){  
  return `<h2>${username} has ${repos} Github repos</h2>`;  
}  
  
async function getRepos(req, res, next) {  
  try {  
    console.log('Fetching Data...');  
      
    const { username } = req.params;  
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${username}`);  
    const data = await response.json();  
  
    const repos = data.public_repos;  
  
    // Set data to Redis  
    client.setex(username, 3600, repos);  
  
    res.send(setResponse(username, repos));  
  } catch (error) {  
    console.error(error);  
    res.status(500);  
  }  
}  
  
// Cache middleware  
function cache(req, res, next) {  
  const { username } = req.params;  
  
  client.get(username, (err, data) => {  
    if (err) throw err;  
  
    if (data !== null) {  
      res.send(setResponse(username, data));  
    } else {  
      next();  
    }  
  });  
}  
  
app.get('/repos/:username', cache, getRepos);  
  
app.listen(5000, () => {  
  console.log(`App running on port 5000`);  
});
```

## 15.2 Load Balancing

Load balancing distributes traffic across multiple servers to ensure that no single server becomes a bottleneck, improving performance and availability.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*fJDa_DJcS1QJgEL1n1AyjQ.png)

Load Balancing

_Code example_: Configuring a simple load balancer using NGINX

```nginx
http {  
    upstream backend {  
        server backend1.example.com;  
        server backend2.example.com;  
        server backend3.example.com;  
    }  
    server {  
        listen 80;  
        location / {  
            proxy_pass http://backend;  
        }  
    }  
}
```

This NGINX configuration sets up a simple load balancer that listens on port 80 and distributes incoming requests to three backend servers.

## 15.3 Minification and Compression

Minification removes unnecessary characters from code files, while compression reduces their size, resulting in faster load times and reduced bandwidth usage.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*VbzLYgSvpFwyVESf3j6L_Q.png)

Minification and Compression (simplified)

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*JMaLXKLPlSikMw32Shq6ww.png)

Minification and Compression (detailed)

_Code example_: Setting up Gulp tasks for minifying and compressing JavaScript and CSS files

```javascript
const gulp = require('gulp');  
const minifyCSS = require('gulp-csso');  
const minifyJS = require('gulp-uglify');  
const concat = require('gulp-concat');  
  
// CSS minification task  
gulp.task('css', function(){  
  return gulp.src('styles/*.css')  
    .pipe(concat('styles.min.css'))  
    .pipe(minifyCSS())  
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));  
});  
  
// JS minification task  
gulp.task('js', function(){  
  return gulp.src('scripts/*.js')  
    .pipe(concat('scripts.min.js'))  
    .pipe(minifyJS())  
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));  
});  
  
// Default task  
gulp.task('default', gulp.parallel('css', 'js'));
```

This Gulp setup includes two tasks: â€˜CSSâ€™ and â€˜js.â€™ The â€˜CSSâ€™ task concatenates and minifies all CSS files in the â€˜stylesâ€™ directory, then outputs the result to â€˜styles.min.cssâ€™ in the â€˜distâ€™ directory. The â€˜jsâ€™ task does the same for JavaScript files. The â€˜defaultâ€™ task runs both the â€˜CSSâ€™ and â€˜js tasks in parallel.

## 15.4 Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

CDNs are distributed networks of servers that cache and serve content to users from a server geographically closer to them, reducing latency and improving load times.
