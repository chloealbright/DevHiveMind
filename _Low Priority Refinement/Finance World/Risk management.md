Buying ETF mitigates volatility and when you buy individual stocks it is like your building your own ETF

## Risk Tier
- 1% on risky volatile trades  
  
- 2% for medium risk  
  
- 3% for low risk or a little more to cover potential losses of risky trades


## Example 
2% of 500 which is my total investment across my trades is $10 so avoid losing $10 to 15 on stocks to manage risk  


  
Let say you buy  
  
You have$10,000  
  
Buy a stock $12 per share you get 50 shares for 600  
  
Your risking 2% so you're limiting your loses to $200 because 2% of 10,000 is $200  
  
Let's say you shares drop to $10.50 your losing $1.50 Per share  
  
200/1.50 is 133 which is the amount of money you can spend on stock which equals about 11 shares of company  
  
The higher the loss is the Lower the amount of money you should invest in stock shares  
  
and vice-versa the lower the loss the higher amount of money you should invest in stock shares 1.50 in this case being the loss  
  
Anything higher than 11 shares in the company can be a big risk


## Compound Interest
- The best way to figure out the amount of money you’ll earn by investing consistently  
- Is to use a compound interest calculator  
- And my favorite one is called money chimp  
  
Example:  
- Say, for example, all you have is $100 to invest every month, that’s $25 a week, or $3.57 a day.  
- If you started investing for example in the s&p 500 index fund at 18 and stopped at 65, with an average return of 8% after inflation.  
- You’’ have 586k, which is half a million  
  
However:  
- If you have more money and you invested $500 month/$16.66 a day for 25 years  
- At 8% return  
- You’ll have $473k, in little have the time ( and if you let it compound for those 47 years, you’ll have 2.9M)  
  
The point I'm making here is:  
- Whether you invest a lot of money or a little bit of money,  
- With some time, compound interest, and investing regularly the money will begin to add up.  
- And some people doing fire literally invest 50-100% of their income, and in 10-15 years retire, and live on their investments. That’s the power of compound interest.  
  
So I recommend: Go use this compound interest calculator and play around with the numbers and see how fast you can reach your goal.

## Dollar-Cost Average
- A lot of you guys either know what this is from that name  
- Or might have heard the term “drip investing” from other YouTubers  
- And the entire idea is, investing consistently every month or often, to protect yourself from market drops, since when the market is down you’ll still keep buying.  
  
Here is what I found:  
  
Lump-Sum Investing: if you saved a lot of money, won the lottery, inherited it, or got a bonus at work  
- Now the pro of investing all your money at ones, is that you start investing right away  
- And if the market is going up, you’re apart of the growth also  
- However, the con for example, if you invested in February pre-pandemic, and didn’t invest again, you’re investment would most likely have dropped by more than 50%, which means your investments would have to double for you to back to normal.  
  
Imagine: if I have $100 and I lost 50%, I need to need to double my $50 dollars left to go back to $100. And that’s the risk of it.  
  
Dollar-Cost Average Little by little:  
- What your doing is, average the price you buy investments by buying them all the time  
- For example, you buy investing in February ( high)), in March, April, June, July, and now what you have is the average price.  
- So it limits the risk
