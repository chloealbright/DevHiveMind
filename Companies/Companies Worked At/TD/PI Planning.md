## TD Bank Fiscal Year and Sprint Planning

> **Note:** The regular fiscal year adheres to a January start, progressing in 3-month increments until the end of the year or the initiation of Q4, which commences in October.

### **Sprint Planning and Story Point Allocation:**

- **46 Story Points per PI:** Aim for approximately 46 story points of work for each Program Increment (PI).

- **6 Story Points Near PI Planning:** Restrict work to only 6 story points in the vicinity of PI planning, scheduled at the end of each quarter.

**Impact on Sprint Timing:**

- **Sprint Start Delay:** Due to PI planning, Sprint 1 begins 1 week later, with the initial week of the first month of the quarter allocated to PI planning.

## PI Planning Schedule

### Q1
- October
- November
- December

### Q2
- January
- February
- March

### Q3
- April
- May
- June

### Q4
- July
- August
- September

These quarterly PI planning sessions ensure alignment with TD Bank's non-standard fiscal year structure, facilitating strategic planning and seamless transitions between quarters.

## Sprint Shirt Size Guidelines

When determining the sprint size for a story, adhere to the following guidelines:

- **XS (Extra Small):** Estimated completion in less than 1 sprint or 2 weeks. Assess whether the task is better suited as a story rather than an epic.

- **S (Small):** Expected completion in 1 to 2 sprints, approximately a month.

- **M (Medium):** Completion expected in 2 to 4 sprints or 1 to 2 months.

- **L (Large):** Targeted completion in 4 to 5 sprints or 2 to 3 months.

- **XL or XXL (Extra Large):** Estimated completion in more than 5 to 6 sprints; consider breaking it into 2 separate epics.
