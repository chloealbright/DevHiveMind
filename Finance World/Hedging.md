Hedging is an advance investment strategy to minimize risk by selling & buying a particular stock or multiple stocks in your portfolio  
  
Put 45% to 50% of investment money in two stocks then the rest of the money into other stocks so if you have 100 dollars have should go to stable long term stocks & the rest to speculative investments
