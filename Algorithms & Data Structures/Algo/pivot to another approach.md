When approaching a coding problem and determining when to pivot to another approach, a common strategy is to set a threshold for the number of failed test cases. Here are some guidelines you might consider:  
  
1. **Small Test Cases:**  
- If you're failing a small number of basic test cases, it might be worth investigating and refining your current approach. Small test cases often cover fundamental aspects of the problem.  
  
2. **Threshold for Failure:**  
- Set a threshold for the number of failed test cases that triggers a reassessment. This threshold could depend on the total number of test cases or a percentage of them.  
  
3. **Analyzing Patterns:**  
- Look for patterns in the failed test cases. If there's a commonality in the type of test cases that are failing, it could provide insights into weaknesses in your current approach.  
  
4. **Edge Cases:**  
- Pay special attention to edge cases and boundary conditions. Failure in these scenarios might indicate that your solution is not handling certain inputs correctly.  
  
5. **Time Complexity:**  
- Consider the time complexity of your solution. If it's exceeding the acceptable limits for larger inputs, it might be an indication to explore alternative algorithms or optimizations.  
  
6. **Code Review:**  
- Perform a thorough code review, focusing on the parts related to the failed test cases. Sometimes, a small bug in one part of the code can have cascading effects.  
  
7. **Discuss with Others:**  
- Seek input from colleagues or online communities. Explaining your approach to someone else can sometimes help you identify potential flaws.  
  
8. **Experimentation:**  
- If you have multiple approaches in mind, experiment with the alternative approach and compare its performance against the current one.  
  
9. **Learning Opportunity:**  
- Treat each failed test case as a learning opportunity. Understand why it failed, and use that information to improve your understanding of the problem.  
  
Remember, the decision to pivot to another approach depends on the complexity of the problem, the nature of the test cases, and your understanding of the problem domain. Being adaptable and open to refining your approach is a key aspect of effective problem-solving.
