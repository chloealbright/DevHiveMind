When trading in a cash account(brokerage), transactions involve actual cash rather than [[Margin Account#Mutual funds |mutual funds]]. Cash accounts have settlement times, impacting the frequency of trading. Unlike margin accounts, there are no restrictions on pattern day trading in cash accounts, and they don't operate on margin, avoiding certain limitations.

Margin accounts, on the other hand, involve a loan from the broker, allowing traders to use the broker's funds and providing features like instant settlement. However, pattern day trading restrictions come into play for accounts with less than $25,000. Exceeding a certain number of trades within a specific timeframe can lead to restrictions until the following week.

The key distinction lies in ownership of funds â€“ a cash account involves your own cash, while a margin account utilizes borrowed funds from the broker. Margin accounts offer flexibility but come with restrictions on the number of trades for accounts with less than $25,000. Understanding these differences is crucial for traders to navigate the limitations associated with each type of account.



## Mutual funds
Mutual funds are investment vehicles that pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. These funds are managed by professional fund managers, and investors buy shares representing their ownership in the overall fund.

Key features of mutual funds include:

1. **Diversification:** Mutual funds spread investments across a variety of assets, reducing the risk associated with individual stocks or bonds.

2. **Professional Management:** Fund managers make investment decisions on behalf of investors, aiming to achieve the fund's investment objectives.

3. **Liquidity:** Investors can buy or sell mutual fund shares on any business day at the net asset value (NAV) price, which is calculated at the end of each trading day.

4. **Affordability:** Mutual funds allow investors to participate in a diversified portfolio with a relatively small investment amount.

5. **Variety of Types:** Mutual funds come in various types, including equity funds (investing in stocks), bond funds (investing in bonds), money market funds (investing in short-term, low-risk securities), and hybrid funds (mix of stocks and bonds).

6. **Expense Ratio:** Investors pay fees for the fund's operating expenses, expressed as the expense ratio, which covers management fees, administrative costs, and other expenses.

7. **Dividends and Capital Gains:** Mutual funds distribute earnings to investors in the form of dividends and capital gains. Reinvesting these distributions can compound returns.

8. **Open-End Structure:** Most mutual funds have an open-end structure, meaning they can issue an unlimited number of shares based on investor demand. The price per share is determined by the NAV.

Investors should carefully consider their investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon when choosing mutual funds. Reading the fund's prospectus and understanding its past performance, fees, and investment strategy are essential before making investment decisions.
