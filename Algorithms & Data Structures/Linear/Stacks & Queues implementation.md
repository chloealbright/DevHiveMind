Using stacks with arrays  
  
Or  
  
Using stacks with the linked list  
  
  
It depends on what you prefer and what your priority is when using them so go back to the pros and cons of arrays and linked list  
  
But arrays allows cache locality which makes it technically faster when accessing items in memory  
  
Versus a link list which has everything scattered in memory and let's listen uses extra memory because you have to have access to the pointers but the memory is more dynamic and an array can be static or dynamic depending on the language where you would have to add to resize the array  
  
  
Using queues with arrays  
  
Or  
  
Queues with Linked list  
  
For queues just do it with the linked list it is O(1) because with array when you pop off you will have to shift the array index which is O(n)
