Yes, in JavaScript, classes and functions that appear to be traditional classes are essentially syntactic sugar over the prototype-based inheritance system that is fundamental to the language.  
  
When you define a class using the class syntax, JavaScript internally uses prototypes to handle inheritance and object creation. The class syntax provides a more convenient and familiar way to work with constructor functions and prototypes.  
  
For example, the following class declaration:  
  
```javascript  
class MyClass {  
constructor(value) {  
this.value = value;  
}  
  
getValue() {  
return this.value;  
}  
}  
```  
  
Is equivalent to the following prototype-based code:  
  
```javascript  
function MyClass(value) {  
this.value = value;  
}  
  
MyClass.prototype.getValue = function() {  
return this.value;  
};  
```  
  
Both approaches achieve the same result, but the class syntax provides a more concise and readable way to express object-oriented concepts. Under the hood, JavaScript still uses prototypes for managing the inheritance chain and method lookups.
