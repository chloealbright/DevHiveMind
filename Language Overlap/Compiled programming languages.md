A compiled language is converted into machine code so that the processor can execute it. 

An interpreted language is a language in which the implementations execute instructions directly without earlier compiling a program into machine language. 

The compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs.  

The interpreted programs run slower than the compiled program. 

In a compiled language, the code can be executed by the CPU.  

In Interpreted languages, the program cannot be compiled, it is interpreted.
