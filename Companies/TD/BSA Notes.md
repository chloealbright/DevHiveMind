Have conversations to gather info from different info sources while also mapping out and planning future conversions in meetings that you will schedule and maybe host you should be aware of the sequence of conversation/meetings and dependencies, also add context make point andÂ create/ask estimation for timelinesÂ Â Â

**AskÂ Questions in this orderÂ 

TheÂ Â 

**What**(broadest question of them all)Â - identify the different scenarios and dependenciesÂ Â 

**Why**- identify the rootÂ overall or at specific scopesÂ 

	Can you tell me what's leading you to this requestÂ Â 

	Do you have any perspective on where... And whatever else you're trying to say it's another way of asking whyÂ Â Â Is there any reason this wouldn't have...Â Â Â 
	
	Instead of asking why directly which can offend or make people feel type away you can be creative as the top example showsÂ Â 
	
	Then you can actually ask why for the question you want to ask so you basically kind of want to build up to actually action why while still asking why in the above examplesÂ 

**Which**Â - Identify the specific point or comparing pointsÂ Â 
**How**Â - identify the stepsÂ 
**When**Â - identify the timeÂ Â 
**Where** - identify the locationÂ Â Â 

Start off with open ended questions then when you want specific information go into closed ended questions which are yes or noÂ or limited choice questions to getÂ decisive responsesÂ 

AskÂ Contextual & nonÂ Â ContextualÂ questions the elicit more information like you can sayÂ so of topic etc...questionÂ 

## PrivacyÂ Â 

As a BSA you have private information do not share with other teams certain information because you're formulating the plans and you want to avoid riling up other people in the department so be aware of the culture and people temperament.Â 

MakeÂ  sure you understand the information you're talking about and who you talking to it about especially stakeholders you don't want to potentially give away information that you shouldn't have that can cause problems between peopleÂ 

So think about how the work or what you're trying to implement may impact them and what you're doing andÂ assess who are supporters and non-supporters when it comes to approaches and decisionsÂ Â

Identify transition requirements they'll always be some type of transition sometimes and it is basically requirements that apply and when moving from the present to the future state and can be temporaryÂ

Shadow stakeholders to understand processes


## Needs + Wants + Data = ***Buisness Requirements***


## Needs of Stake Holders (drives user wants)  


Tends to depend on different factors like to scope of the project and its functionality  
 

Business needs can I arise from multiple things like 

Customer complaints 
New market segments and niches 
profit decrease 
process inefficiency 
New competitor on the market 

 

Needs can come from the top from the bottom which can be probably you from middle management who needs more information 
or from external drivers as mentioned above 

 

Identify stockholders incentives, influences, and motivation then categorize & prioritize  
 

When defining this, if the problem is relatively small they may be less needs to define
but if you are in a situation where you are rebuilding functionality like with tracflo or
you creating something from scratch the number of needs and scope can drastically increase  

 

Look into stakeholders more to identify experience some might be very knowledgably 
thus have a good grasp on their needs while others may need your help to establish needs  

 

You should take into account state of industry and available info and see if there are similar solutions to what your creating  

 

Also identify mandatory requirements vs needs 






## Wants of Users 

 

From number and diversity of stakeholders  

Take into account 

Scope 

Organizational culture  

 

Before establishing wants you need to identify the established information and its level of detail   




## Data 

 
Data Relevance 

Data  Quality 

Data Volume   

Data availability 

Data accessibility(like format) 

 

Data can be db data or documentation   

 

How long of a time period do we have the data like when dealing with sensitive data that you have abide by regulation  

 

How applicable is this data what info is shown 




##  Assumptions

**Factors that are considered to be true, but have not yet been proven.
Â 
### BSAs should do 3 things with assumptions

Identify and document:
Attempts to confirm their accuracy
Manage requirement related risks or risk with how well the solution can meet business needs

Constraints:
Impositions or restrictions on a project that can limit the choices a project can make. Typical categories include business, technical, and external. They always limit a solution, whether it is scope, time  or cost.
Â 
Triple constrain: Budget, time, scope
