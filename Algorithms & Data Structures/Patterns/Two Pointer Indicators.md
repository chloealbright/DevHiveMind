When dealing with problems that involve the Two-Pointer technique, certain keywords or phrases might indicate its applicability. Look out for:

1. **Two Pointers:**
   - Of course, the most direct clue is the mention of "two pointers" in the problem description or prompt.

2. **Pairs of Elements:**
   - If the problem involves finding pairs of elements or comparing elements in a specific way, two pointers might be applicable.

3. **Sum/Target Value:**
   - Phrases like "find a pair with a given sum" or "find elements that add up to a target" often suggest the use of two pointers.

4. **Sorted Array/List:**
   - When the problem mentions that the input is sorted, it's a strong indicator that two pointers could be useful but even if it is not sorted like for three pointer you can sort and apply pattern. 

5. **Intersection of Arrays:**
   - If the problem involves finding the common elements between two arrays, using two pointers on sorted arrays can be effective.

6. **Closest/Smallest/Difference:**
   - Keywords like "closest pair," "smallest difference," or "minimum absolute difference" might indicate a two-pointer approach.

7. **Cycle Detection:**
   - In problems related to cycle detection, especially in linked lists, two pointers moving at different speeds might be involved.

8. **Longest Subarray/Subsequence:**
   - If the problem asks for the longest subarray or subsequence with a certain property, two pointers might be useful.

9. **Removing Duplicates:**
   - If the task involves removing duplicates from a sorted array or list, you could consider using two pointers.

10. **Trapping Rain Water:**
    - Problems that ask for calculating the amount of trapped rainwater often lend themselves to a two-pointer solution.

11. **Moving Towards Middle:**
    - If the problem involves narrowing down a range or searching for an element within a certain range, two pointers might converge towards the middle.

12. **Palindrome Checking:**
    - When the task involves checking whether a string or array is a palindrome, two pointers on both ends are often useful.

Remember that these indicators are not exhaustive, and the best way to confirm the suitability of the two-pointer technique is to analyze the problem and identify patterns that align with the characteristics of this approach.


### Two Pointer & Nested Loops
The Two-pointer technique typically utilizes a single loop for efficient traversal, minimizing the need for nested loops. This approach is favored for its ability to streamline linear or sequential tasks. Although nested loops may indicate an alternative strategy, the primary strength of two pointers lies in their capacity to achieve a more efficient single-pass traversal through the data structure. This technique is especially beneficial in scenarios where optimizing time complexity is a priority.


However, there are cases where nested loops with two pointers might be used:

1. **Two-Dimensional Data Structures:**
   - When dealing with a two-dimensional array or matrix, you may encounter situations where nested loops with two pointers are required. For example, if you need to traverse elements in a grid, you might use two pointers for rows and columns, resulting in nested loops.

2. **Comparing Multiple Elements:**
   - In some scenarios, you might need to compare multiple elements simultaneously. Nested loops can be useful when, for instance, you're checking relationships or conditions between each pair of elements in an array.

3. **Multiple Pointers with Different Steps:**
   - When employing multiple pointers with different step sizes, nested loops may be necessary to manage the variations in movement through the data structure.

Despite these cases, it's crucial to carefully consider whether nested loops are truly necessary, as they can lead to higher time complexity. If a more efficient single-pass approach with two pointers is feasible, it's generally preferred.

In summary, while nested loops with two pointers are less common due to their potential impact on time complexity, there are specific situations where they may be the most appropriate solution based on the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the data structure involved.

## Example 

```typescript
function findPairsWithSum(nums: number[], targetSum: number): number[][] {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);  // Assuming the input array is sorted

    const pairs: number[][] = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
        let left = i + 1;
        let right = nums.length - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            const currentSum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right];

            if (currentSum === targetSum) {
                pairs.push([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]]);
                left++;
                right--;
            } else if (currentSum < targetSum) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
    }

    return pairs;
}

// Example usage:
const numsList: number[] = [1, 4, 2, 3, 7, 5, 8];
const target: number = 12;
const result: number[][] = findPairsWithSum(numsList, target);

```
