Speaking is like driving in traffic sometimes you get into a wreck or get in an argument or you get cut off by someone so slow down and process the information.  


1. Mutual Connections:
	- "I noticed that we share [Mutual Connection] in common, and they couldn't stop singing your praises regarding your insights into the [Industry/Field]."

2. Recent Company News:
	- "I was excited to learn about [Company]'s recent [Achievement/Milestone], and I'm eager to delve deeper into the exciting developments taking place."

3. Compliment or Recognition:
	- "Your work, especially your contributions to [Specific Project/Initiative], have truly left an inspiring mark, and I've been following your journey with great admiration."

4. Shared Interests:
	- "I also noticed our shared passion for [Common Interest], and I'm intrigued to explore how it intertwines with your role at [Company]."


6. Offer Value:
	- "Given my background in [Your Field], I believe there's potential for a mutually beneficial collaboration, and I'm open to discussing ways in which I can contribute to the success of [Company]."

When engaging in conversations, you can also consider saying, "It's interesting, I've been contemplating using or implementing the very thing you mentioned," to spark discussion. Furthermore, you might dig deeper by asking, "What recommendations would you offer for someone looking to excel in [Industry/Field]?" to encourage more insightful conversations.
