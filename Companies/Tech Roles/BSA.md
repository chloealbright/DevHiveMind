A **business systems analyst** is like a translator between a company and its technology. They help businesses figure out how to use computer systems and software to solve problems and improve their operations.  
  
Imagine a company wants to upgrade its website to make it easier for customers to shop online. The business systems analyst will talk to the company's staff to understand what they need, like better search features or smoother checkout. Then, they'll work with computer experts to design and build the new website, making sure it does what the company wants.  
  
In simple terms, a business systems analyst helps companies use technology to make their work better and more efficient by understanding their needs and turning them into computer solutions.
