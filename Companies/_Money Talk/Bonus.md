Bonuses are typically paid semi-annually and are influenced by several factors:

**1. Level of Seniority:** This factor involves a multiplier of the base salary, which increases as employees progress in their careers.

**2. Individual Performance:** Individual performance is assessed using a multiplier, where meeting expectations results in a 100% multiplier and exceeding expectations can lead to a multiplier greater than 100%. Top performers can receive multipliers as high as 300% at companies like Facebook and Apple.

**3. Company Performance:** This factor remains the same for all employees and is based on how well the company is doing.

**Examples:**
- **Bob:** A recent Software Engineering graduate with a base salary of $100,000, a seniority multiplier of 10%, exceeded expectations (individual performance multiplier of 200%), and a company performance multiplier of 120%. His bonus for the period will be $12,000.

- **Alice:** An Engineering Manager with 10 years of experience, a base salary of $220,000, a seniority multiplier of 20%, exceeded expectations (individual performance multiplier of 150%), and a company performance multiplier of 130%. Her bonus for the period will be $42,900.

The bonus amount can vary significantly, and experienced employees tend to receive a higher proportion of their compensation through bonuses.

**Additional Bonuses/Perks:**

In addition to cash bonuses, some companies offer non-monetary perks that can add value to your overall compensation. These include:

- **Free Meals:** Provided on weekdays, which can result in significant cost savings, particularly in expensive areas like the Bay Area.

- **Relocation Bonus:** Helpful if you are relocating from another location, as it can offset some of the costs associated with moving.

- **Health and Dental Insurance/Plans:** These can be worth several thousand dollars annually and are especially valuable in areas with expensive healthcare.

- **Shuttle Service:** This service can save money on transportation costs and make commuting more convenient, particularly in areas with limited public transportation options.

- **Free Education Resources & Certifications:** Access to educational resources and certifications can enhance your skills and market value, which is a valuable long-term benefit.
