The final and central piece of a distributed system is the network that binds all the nodes together. Typically, clouds such as Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft’s Azure, etc., provide the infrastructure for networks on which the servers can run. These networks span Wide Area Networks and are spread across geographies in the world. The cloud networks are typically designed to enable the client/server communication model using protocols such as HTTP.
