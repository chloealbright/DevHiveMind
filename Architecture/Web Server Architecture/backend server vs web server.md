The backend and web server are distinct components in a web application:

- **Backend:**
  - **Function:** Manages application logic, business processes, and interactions with the database.
  - **Responsibilities:** Handles user authentication, business rules, data processing, and server-side operations.
  - **Components:** Includes application servers, databases, and other server-side technologies.
  - **Example Technologies:** Node.js, Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails.

- **Web Server:**
  - **Function:** Primarily responsible for serving static content, handling HTTP requests, and directing them to the appropriate backend component.
  - **Responsibilities:** Manages incoming requests, forwards dynamic requests to the backend, and serves static files like HTML, CSS, and images.
  - **Components:** Focuses on HTTP protocol handling and routing.
  - **Example Technologies:** Apache, Nginx.

In summary, the backend encompasses the overall server-side logic and processing, while the web server is specifically dedicated to handling HTTP requests, managing static content, and routing requests to the appropriate backend components.
