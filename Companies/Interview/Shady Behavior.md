### Decoding Evasive Interview Practices

#### Understanding Role Availability

1. **Positive Atmosphere:**
   - Engaging technical discussions set a positive tone in the interview.
   - Theoretical exploration without a coding test allows for a comprehensive assessment.

2. **Critical Questioning:**
   - When asked about specific questions regarding the role, the atmosphere shifts.
   - The candidate's interest in understanding the role's background becomes crucial.

3. **Red Flags of Evasion:**
   - Evasiveness or reluctance in sharing insights into role availability raises concerns.
   - Transparency is crucial unless the position involves top-secret information.

4. **Role Realities:**
   - Transparent discussions about the role's origin align expectations with reality.
   - Cautionary tales include companies concealing maintenance-heavy positions.

#### Beware of Bait and Switch Tactics

1. **Initial Tech Enthusiasm:**
   - The allure of advertised technologies attracts candidates.
   - Swift transitions to unrelated tasks may deviate from the promised tech landscape.

2. **Persistent Diversions:**
   - Temporary detours can evolve into persistent shifts away from preferred technologies.
   - Vigilance is essential to prevent unexpected and challenging tech scenarios.

3. **Evasiveness on Technologies:**
   - Interviewer evasiveness about technologies may indicate a lack of commitment.
   - Ambiguous references to evaluations or rewrites can lead to unanticipated work environments.

4. **Commitment from Both Sides:**
   - Successful work relationships require commitment from both employer and candidate.
   - Clarifying expectations ensures alignment between advertised roles and actual responsibilities.

#### Conveyor Belt Interview Trap

1. **Swift Questioning Approach:**
   - The conveyor belt approach involves swift, question-heavy interviews.
   - Candidates might feel processed rather than engaged, signaling potential issues.

2. **Warning Signs:**
   - Rapid interviews may indicate high turnover, company expansion, or a mass exodus.
   - Due diligence involves investigating employee numbers and market perceptions.

3. **Contractor Consideration:**
   - Contractors may endure faster-paced interviews, but even startups should allow candidate inquiries.
   - Tempting financial offers should not overshadow the importance of asking questions.

4. **Informed Decision-Making:**
   - The ability to inquire during interviews is crucial for making informed career decisions.
   - Candidates should not compromise on the opportunity to understand the work environment.
