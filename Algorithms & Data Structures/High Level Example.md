# Object Oriented Program explained 

The way I like to describe them is a class is like a template or definition of what it means to be something let's say we have an animal class and a dog variable that stores a new instance of an animal and that dog has access to all the properties Encapsulated in the animal class so it can swim fetch bark maybe even fly but a dog can fly so we might want to exclude that somewhere so that is where interfaces come in were we can define abstract methods or properties we can extend to that truly define what a dog is and what it can do and what it can inherit through inheritance or polymorphism like some type of new trick like having the dog alternate between flipping or walking on back legs . 

JavaScript doesn't have interface and sticks to duck typing and but has implement reserved as a keyword for future use but Typescript does have interfaces 

Polymorphism describes situations in which something occurs in several different forms. In computer science, it describes the concept that you can access objects of different types through the same interface. it lets transform a class or object behavior  

The basic difference between inheritance and polymorphism is that inheritance allows the already existing code to be reused again in a program, and polymorphism provides a mechanism to dynamically decide what form of a function to be invoked. 

Seems like it also establishes new forms
