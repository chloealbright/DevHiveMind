Hi my name is Joshua Carpentier bsa, software engineer, software Carpentier future software architect  
  
I graduated from city tech in 2020 with a bachelor's in computer information systems.  
  
Initially, I was thinking about doing general IT or networking but I realized for IT that a lot of the work involved was basic issues that if people were more observant they could figure outâ€¦. which is pretty funny because you run into similar issues but at a higher level in software development usually when people dont read documentation. As for the Networking I took a terrible entry level class which was the only class I remember falling asleep in but I,m still a little interested in it & plan to learn Kali Linux.
















I feel like software development is like a puzzle where I have completed certain sections of the puzzle while there are other sections to be started and other sections that are partially complete but if you missing pieces and the overall puzzle is a good percentage completed but the image is only something like 480p and I feel like I'm probably like at 1080p trying to upscale all the way to 8K and beyond while filling in the rest of the puzzles pieces  
  
  
  
and I always compare martial arts to programming  
  
  
I got into because I for multiple reason the first was dealing with my mom originally I was thinking about doing general IT but dealing her asking for help drove insane especially ... so I thought about networking because I was interested in networking anonymity especially during when limewire was a thing but the intro class i took was bad  
  
so I decide on programming it was challenging almost like a video game and  
I also like because it reminds of mma because when it comes down to it is high level problem solving but without to worry of getting punched in the face  
  
and with mma there is alot of variables it almost like its own program were you have two programs with there own built in functions
