Hi my name is Joshua Carpentier I work at … as a software engineer I'm Haitian American  
  
I graduated from city tech last year with a bachelor's in computer information systems. Initially, I was thinking about doing general IT or networking  
  
but I realized for IT that a lot of the work involved were basic issues that if people were more observant they could figure out….  
  
which is pretty funny because you run into similar issues but at a higher level in software development.  
  
and  
  
for Networking I took a terrible class that was probably the only class I feel asleep  
  
but I,m still a little interested in it & plan to learn Kali Linux  
  
  
As a software engineer you are taking something in the physical world like a specific problem in a industry and observing it and it's inner workings  
Identifying all of the key information then restructuring that problem into a solution in the digital space to eliminating a lot of the initial constraints and issues of that initial problem in the physical world  
  
  
  
  
But after working in software development for these last couple years  
I, ve learned that I don,t consider myself a software engineer I consider myself more of a software carpenter because I know that one of the highest titles is like software architect and I consider myself a builder of software  
  
  
  
So yeah when it comes to software development I tend to compare to  
  
  
Start with this then find a way to talk martial arts  
  
  
Software development process is like being given a box of blank white puzzle pieces and a partially built puzzle & your expected to put the pieces together without knowing how the pieces fit while the pieces are randomly changing almost like your walking through labyrinth that is actively changing & you have to figure out how the pieces/modules(input-output) connect or correspond to each other  
  
While make sure you have the overall picture still in mind, but as your putting pieces together you realize there is more to the picture and your missing pieces and the picture constantly changing and may be different then you thought so as all of this is happening your basically you trying to bring order to chaos can almost be considered natural order.  
  
================  
Martial arts because there are both forms of high-level problem-solving one just involves you getting hit in the head and losing a couple of brain cells but you put yourself in a chaotic situation where you need to face and analyze a problem that dynamically changes as you try and break it down in small pieces and solve.  
=================  
  
  
A question opens a mind a statement closes of mind always asks don't hold back what you're thinking in an interview  
  
  
  
  
  
  
I have broken things down to science Like I …  
  
I listen to pure instrumentals to avoid influencing, and avoid mentally processing the lyrics. I also try to listen to new music to build Neuroplasticity. I pace back & forth to avoid leaving the room.  
  
Interest  
  
MMA  
  
  
FUTURE  
  
I want to become a Linux power user, get into task automation, work on Open source projects  
  
maybe get into data science, learn c or c++  
  
maybe become a software architect  
  
figure out a way to leverage my software skillet to build my own businesses






Reworded pitch or application word salad to use 


I am looking to become a better well-rounded software engineer. Learning new technologies & becoming a more effective developer using the knowledge I have attained from past experiences. I want to outperform myself & do more than I have done before.  
  
As a software engineer, I have learned to love the planning aspect of things, like creating data models & defining & mapping out the functionality almost like building a blueprint of your software. That is one of the reasons why considered myself more of a software carpenter with the aspiration of becoming a software architect.
