**Considering Company Stability and Compensation Bands:**

1. **Company Stability vs. Growth:**
   - While stability is desirable, assess your personal values and situation.
   - Evaluate the trade-off between stability and growth; consider the potential benefits of a rapidly growing but less stable company.

2. **Personal Values and Job Security:**
   - Assess your ability to quickly find a new job and factor in work visa restrictions.
   - Determine the importance of stability based on your values and confidence in securing alternative employment.

3. **Inquiring About Compensation Bands:**
   - During interviews, inquire about the compensation band for the position.
   - Compensation bands serve as a framework for structuring total compensation and provide transparency in the offer-making process.

4. **Understanding Compensation Structure:**
   - Understand that companies operate within a set range for compensation to manage their financial stability.
   - Recognize that comp bands help in creating fair offers, making merit adjustments, and calibrating promotions while staying within budgetary constraints.
