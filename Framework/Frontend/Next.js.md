[[Express.js]] is a backend framework for building APIs whereas Next. js is a full stack framework that builds upon React to improve the [[SEO]], development experience, and performance of your project. One of these features IS a built-in API routing system that could replace Express.  Next. js doesn't replace Express and you can use them together. Next. js uses some Node.
