-   Traceability enables teams to identify the development of code through various stages. Changes are tracked from inception to the final version. 
    
-   A single source of truth for the historical view of code allows team members to get up to speed quickly. 
    
-   Branching and Merging by working their copy of the code independently (branching), and once the change is made can merge the changes. This also allows teams to work on different streams of workflow - fixing a bug or building out new features. 
    
-   Separation of versions from the original source to establish the latest version and being about to rollback to versions or the original if needed. 
    
-   Management can see assigned tasks, the purpose for the change, and progress to completion. 
    
-   No more silos of communication because teams have visibility and shareability of work to enable simplified workflow coordination. 
    
-   Cohesion to Compliance knowing who changed what when through tracking capabilities. 
    

-   Explain release and feature branching.
