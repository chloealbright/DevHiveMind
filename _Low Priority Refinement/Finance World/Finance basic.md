The stock market is like the future of companies especially now because companies will hire people again but much later in the future so it's like investing in that and waiting until a company improves and grows gaining revenue  
  
A stock is a piece of ownership in a company when you buy a stock you become a shareholder. stocks=share so I a company has 100 stocks and you brought 10 shares you own 10% of the company. buying stocks raise a companies capital and provide liquidity to investors meaning how easily an asset or security can be converted into cash without effecting asset value. then you have liquid assets like a home or property that may be harder to convert into money and maintain the value  
  
that is why people weigh the growth and anticipated liquidity of an asset  
  
lets say want to create a company but need 100,000 of startup capital but only have 60,000 so you make a cooperation with 100,000 shares and sell 40,000 to a friend which means they own 40% of the shares for the company and you 60% since company raised 100,000 and there are / 100,000 share the price per share is 1.00 to increase the price we issue shares on stock market so we sell 1,000 shares which is 1% of company or a fractional share of 500 which is 0.5%  
  
Capital and asset are business terms. ... Assets can be long term, fixed, liquid, or current. Briefly, however, capital refers to the money a business owner has invested in a business, representing the difference between the business's assets and liabilities. Assets are things that add value to a business.  
  
capital is total resources supplied to a business by the owner  
  
Return on capital is basically what is gained after using capital so revenue and all the other stuff  
  
  
  
  
revenue is money made by selling something  
  
then that revenue is divided up to cover the cost  
  
so let's say you made 100,000 in revenue and the cost was 40,000  
  
then you have a gross profit or earnings of 60,000 then you have potential things like expenses like 25,000 then taxes like 20,000  
  
after subtracting that your left with 15,000 which is the net income or earnings  
that you keep  
  
  
now the profit margin is net income divided by revenue so 15,000/100,000  
is 0.15% or 15%  
  
  
price to earnings ratio = price of stock / earning per share  
  
earning per share = net income/ annual share (which includes total shares of company for prior year)  
  
great companies have a high return on capital  
  
earning yield = earning per share/price of a stock  
or example  
the earnings of a company / price spent on company your buying  
  
price of per share

Divided yield = Divided/Share Price  
div yield is apply to stock share cost at the time  
  
1.00/20.00 = 5%  
  
lets say you buy shares for 5,000 the dividen yeild is 5% so the dividend each year will be about 250 because 5% of 5,000 is 250  
  
250 is also the number of shares when times by dividend  
  
  
  
if 5 year div greater than current then overvalued not so good  
  
else current div greater then 5 year div then undervalued good  
  
also good EPS above 8% and consistent growth in earnings and dividends are good indicators to invest besides that look into product and services of company think about will the company product and services be used 20 years later does it have low cost and lasting competetive advantage is it recession proof, have low payout ratio under 75% for dividends for companies like wlmart who payout dividends, does the company has low debt under 70% , is the credit raiting good must have S&P credit raiting of BBB+, P/E ratio should be 25% oe below, P/B ratio should be 3% or lower
