   Summary that gives high level overview with the different testing mentioned 

 

 

Test-driven development is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases  

 


## UAT Testing

Acceptance testing: Verifying whether the whole system works as intended 
 

Functional testing: Checking functions by emulating business scenarios, based on functional requirements. Black-box testing is a common way to verify functions. 

 
Performance testing: Testing how the software performs under different workloads. Load testing, for example, is used to evaluate performance under real-life load conditions. 



Stress testing: Testing how much strain the system can take before it fails. Considered to be a type of non-functional testing. 

 

Usability testing: Validating how well a customer can use a system or web application to complete a task.
