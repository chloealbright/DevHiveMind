Used to  interface and define/config cloud provider service  in terraform code 

Terraform falls under Infrastructure as Code (IaC) 

is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manual processes. With IaC, configuration files are created that contain your infrastructure specifications, which makes it easier to edit and distribute configurations.
