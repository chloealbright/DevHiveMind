# Business Requirements 
Business requirements which are drivers for user stories and all this work refer to the high-level needs/wants and objectives of the organization or stakeholders that drive the development of a product or service.

## Requirement Life Cycle 

The project life cycle encompasses several key stages: Identification, Definition, Verification, Validation, Approval, and Implementation. This cycle allows for iteration, permitting a return to the Definition stage until approval is secured. The process may loop back from the Verified stage to Implementation and ultimately culminate in retirement.

It's crucial to note that change is not automatically implemented, emphasizing the non-linear nature of the life cycle.

**Decision-Making and Stakeholder Roles**

Determining who makes decisions and identifying the primary customer or focus of need are pivotal aspects. The RACI framework, representing Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed, aids in clarifying responsibilities for creating, delivering, reviewing, and validating. 

- **Responsible:** Those tasked with executing specific actions.
- **Accountable:** The individual ultimately answerable for the success or failure of a task or decision.
- **Consulted:** Those whose input is sought before making a decision or taking action.
- **Informed:** Those kept in the loop about decisions or actions but are not directly involved.

Additionally, recognizing that a conversation can serve as another form of traceability, fostering communication and understanding across stakeholders. This ensures a comprehensive approach to decision-making and project progression.
