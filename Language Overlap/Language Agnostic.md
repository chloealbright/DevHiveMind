To streamline your learning approach, consider dedicating 10-15% of your time to grasp the foundational syntax, focusing on essential aspects that cover 60-70% of common tasks in a language like JavaScript. For instance, concentrate on built-in functions for arrays, strings, numbers, and math, omitting more advanced topics like prototypes and asynchronous code initially. This strategy can be applied when acquiring additional languages to become language-agnostic, reserving the exploration of advanced functionalities for future learning based on your role requirements. Prioritize mastering the syntax that proves instrumental in solving coding challenges efficiently.

You can practice doing does whenever you have to back on the job hunt like try doing challenges in different languages.
