At the seed stage, a startup has typically completed its initial funding round, raising between €300k and €1.5M. This early financial boost supports the company as it begins selling its product or service and seeks additional talent to facilitate market entry and testing. The workforce size at this juncture varies, but key insights into equity and stock options can guide potential employees:

**Stock Option Plan Issued:**
- **General Allocation:** Seed-stage startups often allocate between 2% and 8% of their fully diluted shares to stock options for employees. This equity is distributed based on factors like expertise, role importance, and company needs.
- **CTO Equity:** A Chief Technology Officer (CTO) might receive between 1% and 4%, reflecting their crucial role in the company's growth and technological development.
- **Employee Equity:** Other employees can expect to negotiate for 0.25% to 2.0% in stock options. This range accounts for variables such as experience, seniority, and the specific skill set brought to the team.

**No Stock Option Plan Issued:**
- In scenarios where the company hasn't issued stock options during the seed round, employees are typically promised options in the subsequent funding round. However, the strike price for these options will likely be set at the future round's share price, meaning any equity gains are realized from the value created after that round. Here, negotiating for a higher equity percentage, ranging from 0.50% to 4.0%, is advisable due to the delayed benefit.

**Maximizing Equity Stake:**
- Individuals aiming for a significant equity stake or a position akin to a co-founder have two primary strategies: investing directly into the business and/or accepting a lower salary than initially anticipated. These sacrifices can substantially increase equity share, potentially exceeding 4% and reaching up to 10%, depending on the investment's size.

**Impactful Results:**
- Using successful companies as benchmarks, a 1% equity stake secured during the seed stage could result in substantial financial outcomes. For example, at the time of their respective exits (IPO or acquisition), such a stake would have been worth approximately $244M in Facebook, $97M in WhatsApp, $4.9M in Instagram, and $830k in Mint.com.

These scenarios highlight the potential financial rewards of joining a startup at the seed stage, especially when securing equity. However, they also underscore the importance of understanding the terms of stock options and the potential benefits of negotiating for a higher equity stake, particularly in cases where options are promised in future funding rounds.
