State Diagrams

![[State Diagrams.png]]

Activity Diagrams in UML semantics can be viewed as a subset of State Machines with added notations. In these diagrams, vertices symbolize the execution of activities, while edges depict transitions from completing one set of activities to initiating a new set. These diagrams excel at capturing high-level activity aspects, allowing representation of concurrency and coordination.

Consider an Activity Diagram modeling the flow of actions for an incident, emphasizing data flow within a system.

Objects exhibit both behavior and state. UML state machine diagrams portray an object's states and transitions between them.

- An initial state, or creation state, signifies an object's state upon creation.
- A final state has no outgoing transitions.
- Transitions represent progress between states, triggered by internal or external events.
- Optionally, guards indicate conditions for transition triggers.
- Entry and exit keywords signify methods invoked upon entering or exiting a state.

To enhance clarity, rename states like "set destination" or "radius" to their past-tense forms, such as "destination set" or "radius setting."
