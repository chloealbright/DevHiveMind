Exception handling is used in software development to manage and respond to unexpected events or errors that may occur during the execution of a program. These unexpected events may arise due to various reasons, such as invalid inputs, hardware failures, network issues, or programming errors.  
  
Exception handling is useful in situations where the occurrence of an error may cause a program to crash or behave unpredictably, leading to data loss or other undesirable consequences. By using exception handling, developers can anticipate and handle errors in a more controlled and organized way, ensuring that the program continues to operate in a stable and predictable manner.

In general, exception handling is used when a program encounters an error or an exceptional condition that cannot be handled by normal program flow. It involves catching the error, identifying the cause of the error, and taking appropriate action to recover from it or gracefully exit the program.  
  
Some common situations where exception handling may be used include:

	Input validation: When accepting user input, it's important to validate the input to ensure it meets the required format and is within acceptable ranges. If invalid input is entered, the program should raise an exception and handle it appropriately.  

	File handling: When working with files, errors can occur due to various reasons, such as file not found, insufficient permissions, or corrupted data. Exception handling can be used to catch and handle these errors to prevent the program from crashing or behaving unpredictably.  

	Network communication: When communicating over a network, errors can occur due to network failures, timeouts, or other issues. Exception handling can be used to catch and handle these errors to ensure that the program continues to operate in a stable and predictable manner.  
 
	Resource management: When working with system resources, such as memory or database connections, errors can occur due to resource exhaustion or other issues. Exception handling can be used to catch and handle these errors to prevent the program from crashing or behaving unpredictably. it is also important to handle exceptions to ensure resources are properly released.  

	External dependencies: When interacting with external systems or services, there may be errors or unexpected responses. Exception handling can be used to handle these situations and ensure the application continues to function correctly.  

	Debugging: When developing an application, exception handling can be used to catch and log errors, making it easier to debug and fix issues.  

	Business logic: Sometimes the business logic of an application may encounter unexpected conditions that cannot be handled within the normal flow of the code. In such cases, exception handling can be used to handle these conditions and ensure the application continues to operate correctly.  Also for the buisness logic there can be overlap with the other situation metioned above.
