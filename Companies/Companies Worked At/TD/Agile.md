**Agile Frameworks Overview:**
Agile is a mindset employing various frameworks like Scrum, an iterative and incremental software development framework. The process involves a product backlog transitioning into a sprint backlog after sprint planning.

>[!note] Work Status 
> - Committed
> - Uncommitted
> - Unplanned
> 
> User Stories are added to product backlog which is backlog pool before sprint backlog which is for active work Committed Work. Unplanned worked can be pulled from Product Backlog or added on the fly to current sprint and active work can be canceled or De-prioritized and become uncommitted work.     

**Documentation Evolution:**
Documentations are planned across different mediums, refining through successive iterations. An example is starting with Excel and PowerPoint, eventually reaching the final form in Confluence/Jira.

**Agile Frameworks - Scrum and Kanban:**
- **Scrum:** Ideal for newer projects or evolving requirements.
- **Kanban:** Suited for well-defined projects, emphasizing work in progress (WIP) limits. Both use a Kanban board.

**Adaptability and Planning:**
Plans evolve frequently, be it on a two-week, quarterly, or annual basis. Balancing the rate of change is crucial to avoid potential disruptions. Reacting to change requires maintaining stability, accounting for time to value, sustaining performance, and fostering innovation.

**Agile Team Structure:**
Teams consist of 7-9 core members, including developers, BSA, and quality members. Roles may involve a product owner, agile lead, engineers, test developers, architect, and delivery engineer.

**Feature Lifecycle:**
Features progress through multiple PI plans before moving into the "In Progress" stage. This stage covers feature disaggregation into epics and stories during pre-PI planning and the building stage during the PI.

**Feature Completion:**
Upon completion, features can be marked as "Completed," "Declined," or "Canceled." Aspects of a feature include out-of-scope functionality, non-functional requirements, and an analysis or marketing summary.

### **Agile vs. Scrum:**
- **Agile:** An iterative project management approach emphasizing value delivery. Roles include Product Owner, Developer, Team Leader, Technical and Domain Experts, Integrator, Independent Testers, and Auditors.
  
  Tools: Jira, VersionOne, Planbox, Lean Kit, Pivotal Tracker, Axosoft, Active Colab, Taiga.

- **Scrum:** A project management framework with five phases: product backlog creation, sprint planning, working on the sprint, testing/demonstrating, and retrospective. Roles include Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team Members.

  Tools: Jira, VivifyScrum, Targetprocess, Scrumwise, QuickScrum, etc.

- **Artifacts:** Both frameworks involve artifacts such as the Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Product Increment.
