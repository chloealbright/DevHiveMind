Architecture and system design are two related but distinct concepts in the field of software engineering and computer science.

Architecture refers to the high-level conceptual structure of a system. It defines the overall organization and composition of a system, including its components, their relationships, and their interactions. Architecture focuses on the big picture and provides a blueprint for the system's development. It involves making important decisions about the system's goals, constraints, and trade-offs. Architecture typically involves designing the system's major components, their interfaces, and their interactions.

System design, on the other hand, refers to the detailed specification of the system's components, their behavior, and their interactions. System design involves the implementation of the architecture and defines the system's internal structure, modules, data structures, algorithms, and interfaces. System design is concerned with the technical details of how the system will work, including its functionality, performance, scalability, reliability, and security.

In summary, architecture is concerned with the overall structure and composition of a system, while system design is concerned with the detailed specification of its components and their behavior. Architecture provides a high-level blueprint for the system, while system design provides the technical specifications needed to build the system.
