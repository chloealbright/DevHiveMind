TD Ameritrade - Business Systems Analyst 

**Refine

At TD in New York, I spearheaded the adoption of SAFe workflow, boosting organization-wide usage by 12%. In agile ceremonies, I collaborated with Product Owners, Scrum Masters, and Stakeholders, enhancing team productivity. Managing Jira for backlog refinement led to a 20% efficiency gain and a clear roadmap.

Utilizing PowerBI, I crafted logical data models for skill matrices, analyzing key metrics like velocity and cycle time. By conducting needs assessments and collaborating with stakeholders, I aligned upskilling initiatives with organizational goals, optimizing resource allocation.

Collaborating with a third-party upskilling firm, I facilitated an internal program, upskilling 200+ software engineers across 10 cohorts in Advanced Java, Spring Boot, Docker, Event-Driven Architecture, and Reactive Programming. This comprehensive effort spanned 5 months, fostering skill development from associates to senior developers. Lessons learned include strategic planning, efficient collaboration, and successful program execution.




## TracFlo  

I worked at TracFlo as a full stack developer  which is a fintech company inside of the construction industry whose main goal is to eliminate change orders in construction projects by digitizing a lot of the documentation & process between all the parties in a construction project.  So I worked on multiple features on their new app. Like one of the initial things I worked on was the Data migration process between the old WordPress App & the new App. where I created different migration files using Knex.js(query builder) library for different data tables defined in the old app while redefining table relationships because they wanted to change some business logic. Besides that I worked on
several endpoints using Typescript interfaces & types on an Express server & React on the Frontend using a combination of Redux, React hooks, & props & other libraries like MUI. I also worked on features like CreateTickets, & sub features like  Get all, Create, & Edit - equipment & materials. I defined Field definitions for user & labor. Created integration tests for endpoints using Mock Data. 

### Tracflo Statistics 

Create Ticket Endepoint

No stats for old app 

Nothing to compare to 


Get all Ticket 

New app slower 808.00 ms might be implementation difference & doing things more securely  

Old app 576.12 ms 

  

GetLetterByID

if it is used anywhere probably doesn't exist yet since letter is collection of change Order & change order is a collection of tickets so change order isn't ready yet thus letters definitely not setup  

 ----------------------------------------------------------  

Connected to front-end & created endpoint 

--------------------------------------- 

Get all material & equipment 

4338.2ms new app 

8700.4ms old app 

Create materials & equipment 

321.542ms (89) new app took have the time 2x faster 

812.31 ms (98) old app pg load since PHP  

Edit materials & equipment didn't connect but did endpoint 

8222.9ms for material on frontend in new app 

Probably same for equipment since similiar 

## Under the wing Independent contract project 

So I worked on a project for the department of a small business called Under the wing which is an online mentorship platform where I worked on the frontend  on a team, 3 Devs doing things like  defining scope of the project, deliverables, & defining data model . While practicing agile development. I worked with react, bootstrap & other libraries creating reusable components, while maintaining sprint cycles, and creating documentation with markdown  

 Dealing with dependency issues with npm and docker 

## Park alert 

My most favorite project is park alert which is a is a mobile application that helps find parking spots. the inspiration for it was based on the citizen app meets uber. This project pushed me to really think & plan things out by creating many different UML diagrams mapping out the system design & it different parts. I also created a mock app using Dart, Flutter, & a map API. Creating all the diagrams help me develop my whiteboard and debugging code on a whiteboard. But overall I learned what it means to be a software developer because I had to learn a lot in that time period in terms of technology and understanding GitHub while also using Linux as my development environment and examining different projects to draw inspiration in terms of design.
