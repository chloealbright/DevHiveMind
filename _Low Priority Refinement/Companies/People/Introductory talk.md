# Recruiters Salary Talk

Salary isnt important to me I what's more important is finding a place where I can learn and grow and improve on my craft  
  
I don't know the requirements for this role since we are early in the process but do you happened to have a ranged budgeted for the role  
  
  
  

  
  
But I am interested to learn from your side how much do you have budgeted for this role and how close is it to market value



Avoid mentioning entry level Say that you're looking for a role... With these attributes 

Yeah so I recently graduated from college & my coding Bootcamp and I have been doing some consultancy work for the department of a small business to build out my skill set more (BREEZ PAST DETAILS, CONTINUE ON WITH OTHER POINTS)  

So I'm using technologies like React, Bootstrap, and other frameworks and libraries  I picked up during my Bootcamp, where I was introduced to other technologies like Node.js, PostgreSQL, Jest, and the overall full-stack software development life cycle in terms of planning out project scope and defining deliverables and playing out sprint cycles and designing different aspect of the system using diagrams and practicing proper agile development which I have a year of experience with now. 

I would say my most favorite project is park alert the inspiration for it was based on the citizen app and uber just in terms of the system designs aspect of it all the details and the levels of specificity I had to go into taught me a lot and actually helped in terms of whiteboard and debugging code on a whiteboard. But overall I learned what it means to be a software developer because I had to learn a lot in that time period in terms of technology and understanding GitHub while also using Linux as my development environment and examining different projects to draw inspiration in terms of design like going through that whole process which gave me an understanding of the open-source community and filled that missing piece of the puzzle for me when it came to software development as a whole. 

The way I see things is I’m in a race against myself where I’m trying to lap past myself in a race full of obstacles and problems to solve. Like I have grown to see software development kind of like martial arts there are many disciplines within it that you need to master and there is also a lot of planning and strategics that goes into it and It also requires you to be disciplined like a martial artist to the only difference I see between to is if you aren’t disciplined enough in martial arts you risk getting punched in the face especially if you don’t develop a strategy and with software development, I hope I don’t get punched in the face, like who knows with the state the world anything I guess but yeah with software development there can definitely be huge repercussions depending what your working and what data is handled. Like recently Amazon AWS service went down I didn’t really notice anything on my side but the other day I was checking my Con-Edison and didn’t see a balance due but now I wondering if con Edison is affected and do I have a free month of electricity.
