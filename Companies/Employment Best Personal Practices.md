When terminated from a job, be sure to request a formal letter explaining the reasons behind your termination. Additionally, avoid quitting a job abruptly, as it can have similar consequences to being fired, potentially impacting your eligibility for unemployment benefits.



When beginning a new role, there are several important steps to consider:

1. **Employment Type:** Start by inquiring whether the position is a direct hire or a contract role. This information will affect your job security and benefits.

2. **Expectations:** Clearly define your job expectations, responsibilities, and deliverables with your employer to ensure alignment.

3. **Performance and Reviews:** Ask about your current performance and whether you are on track for your annual performance review. This helps you gauge your progress and areas for improvement.

4. **Networking:** Establish a strong network by reaching out to professionals from various industries. Networking is crucial for career growth and opportunities.

5. **Maintaining Connections:** Develop strategies to stay connected with your network. Regular communication and engagement with your connections are essential.

6. **Recommendations:** Consider seeking recommendations from individuals like Tracflo, as positive recommendations can boost your job prospects.

7. **Online Presence:** Ensure your profile statistics on platforms like StackOverflow are well-maintained, as they can enhance your job applications.

8. **Job Applications:** When applying for positions, consider targeting smaller companies or startups, as they may be more receptive to interviews. Apply throughout the week, but Mondays can be particularly effective.

9. **Continuous Application:** Keep applying for jobs even if you are currently employed. This ensures a pipeline of opportunities and connections.

10. **Technical Interviews:** Note that Netflix typically doesn't give algorithm questions for front-end roles.

11. **Exit Interviews:** Be cautious during exit interviews, as information shared can be used against you.

Additionally, when considering roles, ask questions about the company, role expectations, and stability. Pay attention to red flags, such as vague answers or invasive questions about side hustles and previous salary.

Negotiating compensation should be done thoughtfully. Understand the performance review cycle and negotiate based on your role's responsibilities. You can also discuss compensation bands and the cost of living if you're in a major city.

During negotiations, it's essential to be patient and transparent. Consider your options and potential offers, and always emphasize your interest in working for the company. Avoid sharing specific details about other offers, and never lie about numbers. Instead, try to find common ground on compensation.
