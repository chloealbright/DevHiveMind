Naming Conventions 

-   Define and use appropriate naming conventions to make your database schema designs more effective. While you may decide on a particular style or adhere to an ISO standard, the most important thing is to be consistent in your name fields. 
    
-   Try not to use reserved words in table names, column names, fields, etc. that will likely deliver a syntax error. 
    
-   Don’t use hyphens, quotes, spaces, or special characters. They will either require additional work or not be valid. 
    
-   Use singular nouns, not plural nouns, for table names (for example, use StudentName instead of StudentNames). A table represents a collection, so there’s no need to make the title plural.  
    
-   Omit unnecessary verbiage for table names (for example, use Department instead of DepartmentList or TableDepartments) 
    

Security 

-   [Data security](https://www.integrate.io/the-complete-guide-to-data-security/) starts with a good database schema design. Use encryption for sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII) and passwords. Don’t give administrator roles to each user; instead, request user authentication for database access.  
    

Documentation 

-   Database schemas are useful long after you've created them and will be viewed by many other people. So good documentation is essential. Document your database schema design with explicit instructions and write comment lines for scripts, triggers, and other commands.  
    



Expertise 

-   Understanding your data and the attributes of each element helps you build out the most effective schema design. A well-designed schema can enable your data to grow exponentially. As you keep expanding your data, analyze each field in relation to the others you are collecting in your schema.
