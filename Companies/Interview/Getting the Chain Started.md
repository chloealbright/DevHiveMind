But how do you start the chain?  
  
Chances are, you already have contacts in the tech industry. Even if you think you don’t, you probably do. Go scour your LinkedIn, your Facebook, ask your family, talk to people you kinda knew in high school. Nothing is off-limits.  
  
Make a spreadsheet of every single person you know who works for a tech company. Markdown what company they work for, and what their role is at that company.  
  
Then sort all of your contacts by company, and then by role. You should reach out to your most relevant contact at every single company on your list (an engineer is more relevant than someone in operations, etc).  
  
Reach out to every single one.  
  
Invite them to coffee, lunch, dinner, whatever. Always buy. Farm them for referrals and further contacts. If you have a strong network, this is likely to be the most powerful source of leads for you.  
  
This is great because unless you have a stellar resume (which I assume you don’t because you’re bothering to read this guide), referrals are going to be an order of magnitude more impactful than raw applications. This is especially true at top companies.  
  
So keep your funnel healthy. Keep scheduling coffee dates. Keep networking, even if you’re mid-way through your job search. I didn’t stop meeting with people until I had about 4 offers, and even then I still reached out to people at new companies I was interested in.  
  
  
  
  
Speaking, Conversation, & Mental Dialogue  
================================  
  
The reason we hate public speaking is because of Epigenetics we associate public speaking with the feeling of having to defend our self's in front of people like when you are being accused of something like being called a witch in the Salem trials or a murder in court  
  
Improving conversation Skills Get in to conversation with out asking yes or no question  
  
Talk to people with the motive of using them.  
  
Speaking is like driving in traffic sometimes you get into a wreck getting in an argument or you cut off someone by accident so slow down and process the information  
  
  
Mental Dialogue  
  
Be a master of mind not a victim of thought  
  
Create people in your head who doubt your ability and get angry and show them who is right, prove your existence by proving them wrong  
  
Conversation  
  
Being present  
  
Don't rant about a topic  
  
Open ended question who, when, why  
  
Go with the flow  
  
Admit not knowing something  
  
Don't equate your experience to others  
  
Don't repeat self  
  
Forget about the extra details  
  
Listen  
  
Be brief
