Velocity: This is a popular metric used to measure a team's ability to complete work in a given time period. TechBeacon defines it as how many units of software the team typically completes in an iteration [1]. This metric can be used to assess an individual's productivity and how much they are contributing to the team's velocity.  
  
Cycle time: This metric measures the time it takes to complete a single work item, from the start of development to the deployment of the finished product. This metric can be used to assess an individual's ability to deliver quality work in a timely manner [2].  
  
Lead time: This metric measures the time it takes from when a work item is requested to when it is completed and deployed. It can be used to measure an individual's ability to prioritize tasks and work efficiently [2].  
  
Quality and comprehensiveness of testing: The quality and comprehensiveness of testing can greatly affect the quality of the final product. Metrics such as the number of bugs found and fixed, the code coverage of unit tests, and the frequency of test failures can be used to assess an individual's ability to write and execute effective tests [2].  
  
Learning progress: It is important for software engineers to continually learn and improve their skills. Metrics such as the number of training courses completed, the number of new programming languages or technologies learned, and the number of contributions to open source projects can be used to assess an individual's learning progress and dedication to self-improvement [3].  
  
It is important to note that while these metrics can provide valuable insights, they should not be used as the sole means of evaluating an individual's skills and learning. Other factors such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving abilities should also be considered.
