BSA we are in a practice  
  
And specifically on the enablement team which deals with people  
  
  
But BSAs are typically on a technical team


Software engineer level 10 Is were software architect is 


The software architect is specifically at the product family level which only has 1  architect per product family

there can be around 2 to 4 SWE per pod and 1 bsa and one QA per SWE 
list
Right now is social engineer instead of a software engineer


* What problem you were trying to solve  
* What technologies you used  
* What trade-offs you made in the implementation  
* What (if anything) youâ€™d like to improve

=================================  
  
  
So after meeting with John Amelia on learn a lot more things about TD's technical infrastructure  
  
  
So when it comes to US employees we have to domains we can access our primary one which is the BKNG and we have access to a Canadian account under the TDBFG domain  
  
When it comes to these domains they have similar access and are a part of similar AD groups but the Canadian one may have more in terms of access and AD groups  
  
When it comes to GitHub TD has to githubs one with more functionality available like creating multiple repos managing them like you would on a regular GitHub account that is being decommissioned versus another one that's more restrictive and requires you to have Mal codes for adding an application to a repo so for example let's say we want to add our spring boot application and Java code to a repo they each would need their own mal code which you have to request in order to be on a repo and when it comes to the Mal code I'm not sure how to make a request for that in addition to making a request for the repository.  
  
  
When it comes to github actions there's a lot of restricted access but Emilio showed me some workflows that showed docker images
