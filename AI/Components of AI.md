First, there is generalized learning where it takes in information like surroundings. Like if you're outside it will collect data like weather, lighting, dimensions, and other stuff to react to different situations and change the situations  
  
Then there is reasoning where you're given a few choices and you pick the best one based on that generalized learning  
  
Then finally problem-solving  
  
All three of these components is what makes up artificial intelligence giving you the ability to adapt reason and problem solve you have two categories of AI week AI which focuses on one task like a game of go and strong AI which is advanced AI like the robots and movies that are self-aware making things unpredictable  
  
  
  
  
deep learning is a subset of machine learning which uses AI and machine learning is a subset of AI  
  
  
Machine learning is used for minimizing errors and maximizing other things like with GPUs and DLSS in Nvidia GPUs
