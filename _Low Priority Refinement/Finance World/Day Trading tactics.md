## Orders
Stop orders won't execute during the extended-hours session. The stop limit and stop loss orders you place during extended-hours will queue for market open of the next trading day. Trailing stop orders won't execute during the extended-hours session (bad for people who had Nikola which dropped after hours on a Friday)  
  
In a normal market (if there is such a thing), the stop loss can work as intended. You buy a stock at $50, and enter a stop loss order to sell at $47.50, which limits your loss to 5%. ... The bad news is that it will be triggered at the next available market price, which could be many points lower.
