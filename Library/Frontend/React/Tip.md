if you update react on a project this can cause other library to stop working because maybe the library isn't maintained any more so you can look on npm for alt library 

also when updating libraries on project hover & update one at a time to make it easier if things go wrong   

Can add things to global namespace  

By adding script tag in index html in react project 

& can be something like this  

<script> process='test'</script> 

No you have process in global namespace
