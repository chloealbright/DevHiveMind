Work as a Bsa for the first time I supported a technical boot camp and in the process of building a docker bootcamp there was some misconception from our upskilling vendor where they created a docker cohort but using Python when the bank used Java heavily I learned that even though we were dealing with senior level talent I learned they can be a disconnect between management expectation and were internal talent is at because a lot of them had little experience with docker and the curriculum being in python didn't help even though in engineering there is always talk of being language agnostic. and the primary goal was to teach docker.
