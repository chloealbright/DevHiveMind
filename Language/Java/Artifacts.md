Artifacts, in the context of Maven, are the individual software components, libraries, or files that are stored in a Maven repository. These artifacts typically include JAR (Java Archive) files, but they can also encompass other resources like documentation or source code. Each artifact is uniquely identified by a combination of coordinates, including its Group ID, Artifact ID, Version, and sometimes a Packaging type. This information allows Maven to resolve and download the necessary dependencies for a project and ensure consistency in software builds.
