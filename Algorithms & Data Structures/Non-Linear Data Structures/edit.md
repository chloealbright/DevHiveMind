**Map**

A collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique and used to retrieve the associated value.

**Associative Array**

An abstract data type that stores key-value pairs, allowing for efficient retrieval based on the key. It may be implemented as a hash map, hash table, or other data structures.

**Hash Table**

A data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to indices in an array, enabling constant-time retrieval. It may employ collision resolution techniques such as chaining or open addressing.

**Dictionary**

A higher-level abstraction of a hash map in some programming languages, allowing easy access and manipulation of key-value pairs.

**TreeMap**

A tree-based data structure that stores key-value pairs in sorted order based on the keys. Provides efficient operations for finding the minimum and maximum keys and for finding all keys within a given range.

**LinkedHashMap**

A hash table that maintains the order of key-value pairs based on their insertion order. This allows for efficient retrieval based on the keys while preserving the order of element insertion.

**WeakHashMap**

A hash map where the keys are held weakly, allowing them to be garbage collected if they are no longer referenced elsewhere in the program. This is useful for implementing caching or other memory-sensitive applications.

**HashMap / Hash Table**

Hash Table (important to understand different collision mitigation mechanisms and amortized constant-time).

**LinkedHashMap**

(important and commonly asked about in interviews)

**Hash Tables, Hash Maps, and Dictionaries**

Hash tables, hash maps, and dictionaries are all data structures designed for storing and retrieving data based on a key. While they share similarities, they also have distinctions:

- **Hash Table**: It uses a hash function to map keys to array indices, with various collision resolution strategies like chaining or open addressing.

- **Hash Map**: A specific type of hash table that generally employs chaining to address collisions. Each array index holds a linked list of key-value pairs.

- **Dictionary**: Often used interchangeably with a hash map, especially in languages like Python and Java. It represents a collection of unique key-value pairs for easy retrieval.

In summary, hash tables and hash maps are akin in using hash functions for data retrieval, with hash maps being a specific type that typically uses chaining to handle collisions. Dictionaries are commonly used as a higher-level abstraction of hash maps in programming languages.

**Hash Maps and Hash Tables**

Hash maps and hash tables are closely related but not identical:

- **Hash Table**: It is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to array indices. This term is often used in a general sense to refer to any implementation of such a data structure.

- **Hash Map**: A specific implementation of a hash table that usually uses a combination of hashing and chaining to manage collisions. In hash maps, each index in the underlying array generally contains a linked list of key-value pairs, and new pairs are added to the appropriate list when collisions occur.

In essence, both data structures rely on hashing for storing and retrieving data. "Hash map" typically refers to a specific implementation that uses chaining to address collisions, while "hash table" can refer to the broader concept of a data structure that uses hashing.
