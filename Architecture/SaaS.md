It is safe to say that SaaS has been the most popular cloud computing model so far. PaaS delivers applications over the internet and this is the main driver behind its success. The end-user does not need to download the app, instead, they can run the software directly on their browser which makes SaaS highly scalable and, of course, easy to use and manage.  

### SaaS characteristics 

The main characteristics that define SaaS include: 

-   Users are not responsible for managing and maintaining hardware and software. 
    
-   Offers access over the internet, mostly through web browsers. 
    
-   It is hosted on remote servers. 
    
-   It is managed by third-party vendors.  
    

### SaaS advantages 

The main characteristics of SaaS are also its advantages: 

-   in most cases, software accessible on any device over the internet 
    
-   cost and time-effective since you don’t have to worry about installing, managing, or updating software 
    

### SaaS disadvantages 

If SaaS looks too good to be true, well, you’re right—at least in some cases. Here are some cons you should keep in mind: 

-   **No control over the infrastructure**. While PaaS and IaaS offer a certain level of control over the cloud-based infrastructure they run on, SaaS does not. This can cause massive outages—if the SaaS platform is out, so is your application.  
    
-   **Compatibility and integrations**. A SaaS solution may not be compatible with other tools you’re already using, so integrations can cause major issues.  
    
-   **Vendor lock-in**. Similar to PaaS solutions, choosing the wrong vendor can become very costly.  
    
-   **Little to no customization**. Contrary to PaaS and IaaS, SaaS solutions offer very limited customization options on functionality, performance, integrations, etc.  
    
-   **Security**. In addition to having no control over the infrastructure, SaaS users don’t have any control over the security measures put in place by the vendor. In the case of an attack on the vendor and a potential data leak, your organization’s data may also be exposed.  
    

### Software as a service 

-   The need for quick wins is the number one scenario where SaaS solutions would be most beneficial—quick launch of apps without having to worry about server or software issues.
