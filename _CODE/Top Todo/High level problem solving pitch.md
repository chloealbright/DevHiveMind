Ok cool so It all started in 1980 where I oh no I,m just kidding I have so much experience that I had experience before I existed

But name is Joshua Carpentier I,m a BSA, Software engineer, software Carpentier future software architect  
  
I graduated from city tech in 2020 with a bachelor's in computer information systems. I also completed a coding Bootcamp in 2021



## Path 1
  
Initially, I was thinking about doing general IT or networking but I realized for IT that a lot of the work involved troubleshooting basic issues that if people were more observant they could figure out…. which is pretty funny because you run into similar issues but at a higher level like if somebody doesn't read the documentation. As for the Networking I took a terrible entry level class which was the only class I remember falling asleep in, but I,m still a little interested in it  especially when it comes to the hacking side of things  & anonymity like I want be like Mr Robot a little bit and learn Kali Linux.








## Why Engineering  

### Path 1

  
Software development process is like being given a box of blank white puzzle pieces and a partially built puzzle & your expected to put the pieces together without knowing how the pieces fit while the pieces are randomly changing almost like your walking through labyrinth that is actively changing & you have to figure out how the pieces/modules(input-output) connect or correspond to each other  

  
While make sure you have the overall picture still in mind, but as your putting pieces together you realize there is more to the picture and your missing pieces and the picture constantly changing and may be different then you thought so as all of this is happening your basically you trying to bring order to chaos can almost be considered natural order.




I feel like software development is like doing puzzle where you have completed some sections and when step back it turns there id many more parts to complete its kind of like your looking at a picture and looks like 1080p but it turns out you were looking to close and in actuality it is 480p and there are more pieces to put together to get the full 4k image.  



  
Software development is a bit like tackling a puzzle. You conquer some sections, but when you step back, surprise—it's a maze with many more parts waiting to be completed. It's like peeping at a picture that seemed 1080p up close, only to realize it's more of a 480p situation. There's this ongoing quest to put together more pieces and reveal the full 4K image. It's a journey of discovery, piece by piece.

### Path 2
  
Martial arts because there are both forms of high-level problem-solving one just involves you getting hit in the head and losing a couple of brain cells but you put yourself in a chaotic situation where you need to face and analyze a problem that dynamically changes as you try and break it down in small pieces and solve.


and I always compare martial arts to programming  
  

  
so I decide on programming it was challenging almost like a video game and  
I also like because it reminds of mma because when it comes down to it is high level problem solving but without to worry of getting punched in the face  
  
and with mma there is alot of variables it almost like its own program were you have two programs with there own built in functions


### Path 3
As a software engineer you are taking something in the physical world like a specific problem in a industry and observing it and it's inner workings  
Identifying all of the key information then restructuring that problem into a solution in the digital space to eliminating a lot of the initial constraints and issues of that initial problem in the physical world  
  
  
But after working in software development for these last couple years  
I, ve learned that I don,t consider myself a software engineer I consider myself more of a software carpenter because I know that one of the highest titles is like software architect and I consider myself a builder of software


The reason why I chose software development since the time that you put in doesn't necessarily equal the success you can make especially when you get good at it and it can be done from anywhere essentially besides that I like the challenge because initially I was going to networking but the class I took left a bad taste in my mouth so I transition to programming because it seemed like something where I wouldn't get bored at.  
  
and it seems now there might be a trend depending on the company where you can work at home which is a plus meaning you have more time to do other stuff while doing that
