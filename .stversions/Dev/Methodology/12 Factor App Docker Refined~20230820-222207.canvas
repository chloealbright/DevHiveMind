Now the code is available to run in different environments but the environments can very and require additional setup. In order to bypass this we decide to use Docker. Docker enables us to build the app into a image once and consistently deploy container instances for local development, QE, SIT, PAT and Production environments eliminating extra setup.","id":"56e9dc8872bf1c00","x":103,"y":-1742,"width":402,"height":420,"color":"1"},
