Application architecture, solution architecture, and enterprise architecture are all different levels of architecture that focus on different aspects of the organization's technology landscape.  
  
Application architecture refers to the design and structure of individual applications or software systems. It focuses on the specific requirements and technical details of a single application, including its components, modules, and interfaces.  
  
Solution architecture, on the other hand, is concerned with designing and implementing integrated solutions that address specific business needs or problems. It typically involves the coordination of multiple applications, technologies, and platforms to create a cohesive solution that meets the organization's needs.  
  
Enterprise architecture is a more holistic view of the organization's technology landscape. It involves the design and management of the entire technology infrastructure, including applications, solutions, networks, and data. Enterprise architecture is concerned with aligning technology with the organization's business goals and objectives, as well as ensuring that different technology components work together effectively.  
  
In summary, application architecture focuses on the design of individual applications, solution architecture focuses on the integration of multiple applications to address specific business needs, and enterprise architecture focuses on the overall design and management of the entire technology infrastructure.
