Let you go backwards through the list  
  
It essentially has one more pointer between each node unlike the single list which has one and only goes in one direction the second pointer on the doubly linked list let you go backwards  
  
Searching through the doubly link list can be more efficient  
  
Doubly linked list can take up more memory

## Circular Doubly Linked ListsÂ 
![[DoubleCircularLinkedLists.png]]



A circular doubly linked list is a mixture of a doubly linked list and a circular linked list. Like the doubly linked list, it has an extra pointer called the previous pointer, and similar to the circular linked list, its last node points at the head node. This type of linked list is the bi-directional list. So, you can traverse it in both directions.
