## Company Stability  

**Considering Company Stability and Compensation Bands:**

1. **Company Stability vs. Growth:**

   - Be cautious of role changes, ensuring that performance reviews align with your familiarity and experience in the new role.

   - If a 3% raise isn't achievable after a year, aim for a 5% or 4% raise after two years, considering your contributions and market standards.

4. **Potential Red Flags for Job Security:**
   - Be aware that being put on a performance improvement plan might be a precursor to termination, especially in unfamiliar roles.

5. **Negotiation Approach:**
   - During salary negotiations, propose adjustments based on performance. For instance, suggest a lower starting salary with a commitment to revisit and potentially increase it after a successful 90-day performance period.




**Technical Resume Statistic Example:**

Incorporating performance metrics into your technical resume can effectively showcase your impact. For instance:

- **User Interaction Efficiency:**
  - Demonstrated the ability to enhance user experience by optimizing software processes.

This statistic translates to an annual user interaction rate of 350.4, highlighting sustained efficiency and proficiency in handling high workloads.

   - Consider going for direct hires to streamline communication and potentially negotiate terms more effectively.
