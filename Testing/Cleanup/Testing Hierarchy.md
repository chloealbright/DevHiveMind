![[Testing Priority.jpeg]]

To optimize your testing strategy, allocate 10% for [[End to End Testing]], 20% for [[Integration vs System Integration Testing#Integration Tests |integration tests]], and prioritize 70% for [[Unit testing]], given their efficiency. This balanced approach ensures comprehensive coverage across individual classes through unit testing. Emphasize end-to-end and integration tests on critical user journeys. Additionally, consider the two main testing types: manual and automated testing.
