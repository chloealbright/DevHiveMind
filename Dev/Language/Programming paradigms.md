Classes are instances of objects which encapsulate a state and behavior that object is essentially a definition of the class 

Verbose meaning using or expressed in more words than are needed. 

State consist of things like Fields attributes instances variables 

Behavior is what you do with those things mostly methods 

When creating the class you are creating the class definition. The constructor is it method that runs once upon creation of the object  

Object-oriented programming is good for modeling and reusability and easier to test  

In object-oriented programming pass fewer variables in your function 

A method is basically a function in a class when it comes to JavaScript 

Arrays are a special type of object. The typeof operator in JavaScript  

returns "object" for arrays. But, JavaScript arrays are best described as arrays. 

Promises and async are the same thing but just different syntax and Async is basically cleaner looking 

	forEach is BAD! for Async Await Code  
	
	doesn't await for promises or return anything like other higher order function 
	
	a regular for loop would be more better 

Next is functional programming which output depends on the input given  

Within functional programming is pure functional programming where we don't store State and don't mutate incoming data meaning if you are given an array you'll give back a new array 

Also for functional programming data and procedure are separate not together like object-oriented programming 

Next is prologue programming which is similar to some of the stuff in discrete math like De Morgan's law and implications and things 

And last is procedure programming which uses things like Assembly language which is very old  

JavaScript. length isn't a function it's a property so if they ask you about the run time but it depends on the language because it might be different for something like Java 

But for JavaScript, its constant runtime 

JavaScript doesn't have private methods but they use an underscore method name and convention to represent a private property or method to let other developers know that it shouldn't be accessed even though it can be accessed 

JavaScript doesn't have a linked list you have to build your own 

JavaScript doesn't have its own stack of queues you have to build it 

Middleware uses database functions you create basically business logic 

Array & Memory 

---------------------------- 

So because JavaScript is garbage collected that is memory is managed automatically. 

This gets automatically garbage collected and deleted because nothing is pointing to it. 

However, there are low-level languages where you have to manage your own memory and you have to manually 

delete this on the referenced item in memory. 

And this can cause a lot of possible issues when you leave memory that's not being used in memory which is a valuable resource. 

But then there are also benefits with non-garbage collected languages where you get to manage your own memory so you can make things really really fast that efficient.
