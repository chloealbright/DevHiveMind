## **Setting up Meetings for Strategic Conversations:**

Before scheduling a meeting, clearly define the problem statement and the meeting's purpose. Attach an agenda to the email, including thought-provoking questions to guide discussions.

## **Key Considerations for Conversations:**

- Decide on the type of conversations required, participants, focus subjects, and allocate effort accordingly.

## **Conversation Tactics:**

- Encourage participation by making statements and inviting corrections.
- Rephrase answers to ensure alignment with participants.

## **Objectives of Conversations:**

- Identify inputs, outputs, dependencies, data, needs, and wants.
- Explore other ideas for potential future discussions.

## **Action Items:**

- Send questions in advance if required; otherwise, provide an agenda with topics.
- Document and table out-of-scope ideas.
- Utilize surveys, workshops, or focus groups for comprehensive discussions.
- Distinguish between known and unknown aspects.
- Conduct SWOT analysis.

## **Meeting Dynamics:**

- If a meeting is missed, request action points.
- Group and categorize stakeholders.
- Establish a requirements baseline by determining the project typeâ€”predictive or adaptive.

   - Predictive projects involve formal processes, complex change control, and scope documentation.
   - Adaptive projects involve informal processes, streamlined change control, and a focus on the product backlog.

- Scrutinize documentation for essential questions.

## **Post-Meeting Actions:**

- Before concluding, ask for additional questions or topics that may have been missed.
- Close out the meeting and follow up, especially if extensive information was discussed, to verify details.
