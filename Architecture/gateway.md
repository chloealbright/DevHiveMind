In programming, a gateway typically refers to an interface or entry point that connects different systems or networks. It acts as a mediator, facilitating communication and data exchange between disparate components. Gateways can be hardware or software-based and are often used to bridge the gap between incompatible systems, enabling seamless interaction. Examples include API gateways that manage communication between microservices or network gateways that connect different networks with distinct protocols.
