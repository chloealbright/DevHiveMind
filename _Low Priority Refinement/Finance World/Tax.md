## Tax Lien Definition  
  
A tax lien is a claim by the government on a property due to the owner's failure to pay taxes owed. The lien gives the government the legal right to take possession of the property in order to satisfy the debt. The existence of a tax lien may affect the owner's ability to sell or borrow against the property until the debt is paid.  
  
  
  
  
## Where to purchase tax liens properties in New York  
  
In New York, tax liens are typically sold by the county government, and interested parties can participate in the auction process to purchase tax liens on properties. The county or municipality will advertise the auction, which can often be done online, in local newspapers, or through mailings to registered bidders. To participate, you may need to register beforehand and provide a deposit or a letter of credit.  
  
You can find information about upcoming tax lien auctions in New York by contacting the county treasurer or finance department. It's also a good idea to research the local rules and regulations for purchasing tax liens, as well as any restrictions on the properties being auctioned, before participating in the auction process.

## Capital losses
Your claimed capital losses will come off your taxable income, reducing your tax bill. Your maximum net capital loss in any tax year is $3,000. The IRS limits your net loss to $3,000 (for individuals and married filing jointly) or $1,500 (for married filing separately).

Numbers can change because of inflation

the first 10,000 you make will be taxed in the first bracket which is like 10%  
  
Then the next 30,000 will be taxed on the next bracket which is like 12%  
  
Then the 60,000 will be taxed at the next higher tax bracket which would be 22%
