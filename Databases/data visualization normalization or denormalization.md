The normalization or denormalization of database tables can have a significant effect on the visualization of data in Power BI. Here's how each approach can impact your data visualization:  
  
**Normalization:**  
  
1. **Clarity:** Normalized tables can maintain data integrity and reduce redundancy, making your data more logically organized. This can lead to clearer and more structured data models in Power BI.  
  
2. **Flexibility:** Normalization allows for efficient data updates and maintenance. If your data changes frequently, normalized tables can be more adaptable to modifications without affecting the integrity of the data.  
  
3. **Complexity:** Normalized data models may involve multiple related tables and require more complex relationships and DAX calculations in Power BI. This can increase the complexity of report development.  
  
**Denormalization:**  
  
1. **Performance:** Denormalized tables can improve query performance in Power BI, especially for complex reports with many joins. Flattening the data can make it easier and faster to create visualizations.  
  
2. **Simplicity:** Denormalization can simplify the data model in Power BI, making it more straightforward for report authors to create visuals and calculations.  
  
3. **Storage:** Denormalized tables often require more storage space compared to their normalized counterparts. Consider the trade-off between storage costs and improved performance.  
  
In practice, many Power BI projects find a middle ground. They maintain normalized databases for data integrity and compliance with relational database principles while creating optimized views or data structures for reporting purposes. These optimized structures can be denormalized to improve performance and simplify report development.  
  
Ultimately, the choice between normalization and denormalization should align with your specific reporting requirements, data volume, and performance considerations. Power BI provides tools and features to handle both normalized and denormalized data, allowing you to design your data model according to your needs.
