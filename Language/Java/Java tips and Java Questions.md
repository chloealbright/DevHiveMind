in the future try  rewriting  code for  problems

Java is open source while something like C++ is not and cost money to use

A constructor is used to construct an instance of a class. Unlike properties and methods, the constructors of a superclass are not inherited by a subclass. They can only be invoked from the constructors of the subclasses using the keyword super. The syntax to call a superclass’s constructor is: super(), or super(parameters);

Static method

the only time you can create an object in or outside of a static method is when you use a constructor otherwise if it is not a constructor method, you can create an object from that method.

also when you don't make a method static you have to create an object

Static is used so that the main method can be accessed directly by a class instead of creating object of main class

Java constructor

Why have a constructor with an empty body or a body with some code than two or three more overloaded constructors

Classes and objects

System.out.print, the system is the class, the out is the object, the print is the method and there are many classes with different objects that have different methods

cant use with super and sub classes

this.color = color; // Illegal

this.filled = filled; // Illegal

only for one class with private variables and methods

but They can, however, be accessed/mutated

through public accessors/mutators if defined in the superclass.
