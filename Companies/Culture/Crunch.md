Only do crunch if it is rare and isn't happening all the time and you're not in an actual toxic environment


### Decoding the Unspoken: Insights into Evasive Interview Practices

**Evaluating the Mystery Behind Role Availability**

The interview room seems promising - engaging technical discussions, theoretical explorations, and a positive vibe. As the conversation flows, the interviewer opens the floor for your questions. Here lies a critical juncture. The air suddenly shifts, and the sunlit atmosphere darkens with a single query: "Do you have any specific questions about the role?"

For a software engineer, understanding why a position is available is vital. Is it a new role for an ambitious project, or has someone departed, creating a vacancy? The discerning candidate seizes this opportunity to unravel the layers behind the role's existence. A well-prepared interviewer will readily share insights, but when evasion or reluctance surfaces, it raises red flags.

Uncovering the truth behind the role's availability is a two-way street. Top-secret positions may limit discussion about technologies or team details, but in most cases, transparency is crucial. If the interviewer avoids the topic, it might signal past uncertainties or an unfillable role. Instances with monolithic companies concealing the maintenance-heavy nature of a position are cautionary tales. A genuine employer aligns role expectations with reality, fostering a healthy work environment.

**Beware of the Bait and Switch Tactics**

The bait and switch strategy, where an enticing technology lures candidates, only to be substituted with unrelated tasks, is an unfortunate reality. Swiftly transitioning from your preferred tech stack to an unexpected legacy codebase becomes a common narrative. The initial promise of temporary detours often evolves into persistent diversions, leaving you grappling with unforeseen technologies.

Vigilance is key. An interviewer's evasiveness about technologies could indicate a lack of commitment to the advertised role. Ambiguous mentions of technology evaluations or hypothetical rewrites may leave you stranded in a tech landscape far removed from your expectations. Commitment from both sides is crucial for a successful work relationship.

**The Conveyor Belt Interview Trap**

The conveyor belt approach, characterized by swift, question-heavy interviews, might be a subtle warning. If your interview feels like a rubber stamp process, pushing candidates in and out without allowing meaningful interactions, it raises concerns. This scenario may suggest a high turnover, rapid company expansion, or an exodus-like situation.

Due diligence is your ally. Investigate employee numbers, market perceptions, or tap into insider information through company contacts or agencies. While contractors may endure faster-paced interviews, even a well-funded startup should afford candidates the chance to inquire. Don't let tempting financial offers blind you; the ability to ask questions is your right, essential for making informed career choices.
