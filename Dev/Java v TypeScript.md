Java:

Syntax: Java uses a C-style syntax with curly braces for defining code blocks. It is a statically typed language, so variables are declared with their type at the beginning of the code, and their type cannot be changed during runtime.

Object-Oriented Programming: Java is known for its strong support for object-oriented programming (OOP). It has features like classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it easy to develop complex applications with reusable code.

Exception Handling: Java has built-in support for exception handling, which allows developers to handle errors in a structured way. Exceptions can be thrown with the "throw" keyword and caught with the "try-catch" block.

Garbage Collection: Java has automatic memory management with a garbage collector that frees memory allocated by objects that are no longer being used.

Generics: Java has support for generics, which allow developers to define type parameters for classes, interfaces, and methods.

TypeScript:

Syntax: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so it has a syntax similar to JavaScript. It supports features like arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring. It also has optional static typing with the use of type annotations.

Object-Oriented Programming: TypeScript is also an object-oriented language, but it has a more flexible implementation of OOP than Java. It has features like classes, interfaces, mixins, and abstract classes. TypeScript also supports some functional programming concepts like higher-order functions and lambdas.

Union and Intersection Types: TypeScript has support for union and intersection types. Union types allow a variable to have multiple types, while intersection types allow a variable to have properties and methods from multiple types.

Type Inference: TypeScript has a type inference system that can automatically detect the type of a variable based on its value. This can save developers time by reducing the need for type annotations.

Modules: TypeScript has built-in support for modules, which allow developers to organize their code into separate files and import/export them as needed.

In summary, while both Java and TypeScript support object-oriented programming and have similar syntax, they differ in their approach to typing, exception handling, garbage collection, and some advanced features like generics and union/intersection types. TypeScript also has more modern language features like type inference and support for modules.
