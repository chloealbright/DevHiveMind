## Why Engineering  

### Path 1

  
Software development process is like being given partially built puzzle with a box of blank white puzzle pieces and your expected to put the pieces together without knowing how the final picture looks like because your creating picture that doesn't exist and the process of creating that picture can be very chaotic and it is your job to bring order and structure to bring all those pieces together to create a master piece.


Building software is like getting a half-finished puzzle with blank white puzzle pieces. You're basically creating a picture that doesn't exist, and the whole process can be a bit chaotic and you have to take all those pieces and bring order and structure to all that chaos to create a master piece.



Developing software is a bit like getting a puzzle with half-finished and blank white pieces. You're essentially crafting a non-existent picture, and the process can get pretty wild. Your job? Tame the chaos, organize those pieces, and turn it into a masterpiece.



### Path 2

One of the reason I like software engineer is because it very variable and seems very nebulous I like compare to martial arts because it can be very variable as well especially when you think about all the way a fight can go along with all the micro decisions being made on the fly. the only difference between engineering and martial arts is one just involves you getting hit in the head and losing a couple of brain cells but you put yourself in a chaotic situation where you need to face and analyze a problem that dynamically changes as you try and break it down in small pieces and solve the problem in front of you.
