A Binomial Heap is a collection of Binomial Trees, where each Binomial Tree adheres to the Min-Heap property, and there can be at most one Binomial Tree of any degree.

The key distinction between a Binary Heap and a Binomial Heap lies in their structure. In a Binary Heap, the structure is that of a single tree, specifically a complete binary tree. In contrast, a Binomial Heap is composed of smaller trees, forming a forest of trees, with each tree being a binomial tree. While a complete binary tree can accommodate any number of elements, a binomial tree of order N always contains precisely 2*N elements. Consequently, a Binary Heap relies on a single complete binary tree, while a Binomial Heap may consist of multiple binomial trees to collectively form the heap.
