1. **Annual Reports:**
   - **Action:** Begin by thoroughly examining annual reports for comprehensive insights into a company's financial health and future plans.

2. **Technical Analysis:**
   - **Focus on Trends:**
     - Analyze a 180-day uptrend on the 4-hour time frame for a comprehensive view of stock performance.
     - Observe the stock's proximity to the Moving Average (MA) line.

3. **Market Comparison:**
   - **Performance Relative to Indices:**
     - Compare stock percentage performance to benchmark indices like SPY or S&P 500, preferably using a 5-minute chart.

4. **Price Drops and Stability:**
   - **Strategy:**
     - When stock prices drop, wait for stabilization.
     - Confirm the emergence of an uptrend or reversal before taking action.
     - Acknowledge that pullbacks are common in the market.

5. **Market Dips and Federal Reserve Influence:**
   - **Opportunistic Investment:**
     - Utilize opportunities during market dips, especially when the Federal Reserve buys company bonds.
     - Recognize the potential for increased market stability with such interventions.

6. **NASDAQ Indicator:**
   - **Significant Dips:**
     - When NASDAQ experiences a 3% downturn, anticipate potential stock drops.
     - Consider strategic buying during these times, especially if declines exceed 5% or 10%.

7. **Political Landscape Consideration:**
   - **Market Under Different Administrations:**
     - Note that, historically, stock markets tend to perform well under Republican administrations, often due to perceived fewer restrictions on companies.

Creating a systematic approach incorporating these elements can contribute to informed and strategic decision-making in stock trading.
