In object-oriented and functional programming, an immutable object (unchangeable object) is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. This is in contrast to a mutable object (changeable object), which can be modified after it is created. 

some methods or data structures can be unchanging over time or unable to be changed. which is immutable. 

Typescript is good for immutable meaning unchanging over time or unable to be changed or functional programming
