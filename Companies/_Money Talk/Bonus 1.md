Bonuses are usually paid on a semi-annual basis and are typically dependent on a few factors - level of seniority, individual performance in that time period, company performance in that time period.  
  
Level of seniority - This is usually a multiplier of the base salary, and the multiplier increases as the employee moves up the ranks  
Individual performance - This is a multiplier of how well an employee performed in that time period. E.g. meeting expectations results in a 100% multiplier and exceeding expectations results in a >100% multiplier. Companies like Facebook and Apple reward their top performers handsomely, and the multiplier can go up to 300% for the extremely high-performing employees  
Company performance - How well the company is doing. This multiplier will be the same for all employees  
Examples#  
Bob is a Software Engineer fresh out of college. His base salary is 100,000, is a fresh grad (seniority multiplier: 10%), crushed expectations for the half (individual performance multiplier: 200%) and his company did pretty well (company performance multiplier: 120%). For that half, his bonus will be as follows:  
  
Bonus: 100,000 x 50% (half a year) x 10% (seniority) x 200% (individual performance) x 120% (company performance) = 12000  
Alice is an Engineering Manager with 10 years of professional experience. Her base salary is 220,000, is an experienced engineering manager (seniority multiplier: 20%), exceeded expectations for the half (individual performance multiplier: 150%) and her company did pretty awesome (company performance multiplier: 130%). For that half, her bonus will be as follows:  
  
Bonus: 220,000 x 50% (half a year) x 20% (seniority) x 150% (individual performance) x 130% (company performance) = 42900  
Hence the amount of bonus you receive can be highly variable and senior employees get a higher proportion of their compensation from bonuses.
