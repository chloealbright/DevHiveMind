---
When describing the features you created in a codebase on your resume, you want to provide a comprehensive yet concise overview of your contributions. Here are some statistics and features you can consider collecting and presenting:  
  
1. **Code Metrics:**  
	- **Lines of Code (LOC):** Highlight the size of the codebase you worked on.  
	- **Cyclomatic Complexity:** If applicable, mention how you addressed code complexity.  
  
2. **Productivity Metrics:**  
	- **Timeframe:** Specify the duration of the project or feature development.  
	- **Sprints or Iterations:** Mention the number of sprints or iterations you participated in.  
  
3. **Feature Implementation:**  
	- **Number of Features:** Quantify the number of features you contributed to.  
	- **Complexity Levels:** Mention if you worked on basic, intermediate, or complex features.  
  
4. **Code Quality:**  
	- **Bug Fixing:** If you resolved bugs, mention the number and types of bugs.  
	- **Code Reviews:** Note your involvement in code reviews.  

5. **Technologies and Tools:**  
	- **Technology Stack:** List the technologies and tools you used.  
	- **New Technologies:** Highlight if you introduced any new technologies or practices.  

6. **Testing and QA:**  
	- **Unit Tests:** Specify if you wrote unit tests.  
	- **Test Coverage:** Mention the percentage of code covered by tests.  

7. **Collaboration and Teamwork:**  
	- **Collaboration Tools:** Specify tools used for collaboration (e.g., Git, Jira).  
	- **Team Size:** Indicate the size of the development team.  

8. **Performance Improvements:**  
	- **Optimizations:** Describe any performance optimizations you implemented.  
	- **Scalability:** If applicable, mention improvements in system scalability.  

When describing your achievements on your resume:  
  
- **Quantify Impact:** Use specific numbers to quantify your impact, such as "Implemented X features, resulting in a Y% increase in system efficiency."  
  
- **Action Verbs:** Begin bullet points with strong action verbs (e.g., "Developed," "Implemented," "Optimized") to convey a sense of accomplishment.  
  
- **Focus on Results:** Emphasize not just what you did, but the positive outcomes or improvements resulting from your work.  
  
- **Tailor to Job Descriptions:** Customize your resume based on the specific job descriptions to which you are applying, emphasizing relevant skills and achievements.  
  
Remember to balance specificity with brevity and focus on the most significant contributions to make your resume compelling to potential employers.

If I'm working on a feature that didn't exist previously, as opposed to something that was refactored by you, I wouldn't solely emphasize performance improvements. Instead, my focus would extend to various metrics pertinent to the newly introduced feature, ensuring a holistic evaluation that goes beyond just performance considerations.

## **Technical Resume Statistic Example:**

Incorporating performance metrics into your technical resume can effectively showcase your impact. For instance:

- **User Interaction Efficiency:**
  - Demonstrated the ability to enhance user experience by optimizing software processes.
  - Achieved an impressive throughput of 40 users per hour during peak periods.

This statistic translates to an annual user interaction rate of 350.4, highlighting sustained efficiency and proficiency in handling high workloads. Also elongate stats like for example instead of saying something like 1 year say may 12 month
