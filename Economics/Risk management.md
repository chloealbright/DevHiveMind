### ETFs and Volatility:
- Buying ETFs helps mitigate volatility.
- Investing in individual stocks is akin to building a personalized ETF.
- Monitor risky investments after hours.
- Bankruptcy doesn't necessarily mean loss; it can involve debt restructuring.
  - Be cautious with dividend stocks, as they can impact company profits.

### Risk Tier Management:
- Allocate 1% for risky, volatile trades.
- Dedicate 2% for medium-risk investments.
- Assign 3% for low-risk, covering potential losses.

### Risk Calculation Example:
- Total investment: $10,000.
- Buy a stock at $12/share, acquiring 50 shares for $600.
- Risk limit: 2% ($200).
- If the shares drop to $10.50, losing $1.50/share, reevaluate.
- With a $200 loss limit, you could spend around $133 on the stock (about 11 shares).
- Adjust investment based on potential losses – higher loss, lower investment, and vice versa.

### Compound Interest:
- Utilize a compound interest calculator like Money Chimp.
- Example: Invest $100 monthly from 18 to 65, with an 8% average return after inflation – yields $586k.
- Investing $500 monthly for 25 years at 8% return accumulates $473k.
- Emphasizes the power of regular, consistent investing and compound interest.
- Recommends experimenting with the compound interest calculator to set and reach financial goals.

### Dollar-Cost Averaging:
- Consistent, frequent investing to mitigate market drops.
- Contrasts Lump-Sum Investing with Dollar-Cost Average:
  - **Lump-Sum Investing:** Immediate investment but susceptible to market fluctuations.
  - **Dollar-Cost Average:** Spreading investments over time, averaging purchase prices.

These strategies and risk management principles provide a comprehensive approach to investment, balancing potential returns and minimizing risks.
