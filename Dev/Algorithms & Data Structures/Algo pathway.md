in terms of list element order & Fixed Length

![[unnamed (11).gif]]

First identify problem  

Don't focus on the output too much  

check attributes if num of param greater then one what is being compared  

if array of nums check range, order, type of nums:  

	Natural num(pos & 0), Integers(Natural & neg), Rational num(decimal, fraction), Min/Max  

if array of strings think built in string/array functions else array of characters you can think more about algo patterns then string methods ask about empty space string length range of characters  

if string of various characters think ascii a little don,t default to it  

odd/even  

think if you need to traverse every element which goes back to understanding problem also looping from start or end also duplicates you can store things in a set instead of adding one by one  

## Sorted  
Binary search focus on middle  

## Partially sorted  
typically cyclic sort especially if you have all nums in range  

## Unsorted  
can be anything outside of Binary or Cyclic depending on what is being asked but if preserving order isn't a priority you can sort then maybe think about binary search otherwise your doing some type of pattern that might include a linear search  

Fixed length you maybe dealing with a matrix or array with elements of a fixed length so it may be some form of Merge Interval where values are unsorted or sorted overall  

can apply to numbers or if dealing with ascii values for letters  

where you focus conditional logic on  

with nested objects like Json it can be tree like in terms of repetitive work and going through a file directory so you can do recursion then you get into memiozation  

### Keep scope in mind  
Solve the right problems and pay attention to the scope of the problems and how they affect the greater scope of the world or your world  

using precision when it comes to scope is good to learn about specific things but again when it comes to precision you are focus on a specific scope of element of that scope  

but when you blunt you are less precise but can experience things and get a general feel  

this why you cant use one tool for everything you need to learn how use and alternate between being blunt and precise in your approach
