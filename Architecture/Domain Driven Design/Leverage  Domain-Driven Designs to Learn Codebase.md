1. **Understand the Domain:**
   - Begin by gaining a deep understanding of the healthcare domain. Learn about the key concepts, processes, and terminology used in healthcare.

2. **Identify Core Domains:**
   - Identify the core domains within the healthcare tech system. For example, you might have domains for patient management, medical records, billing, etc.

3. **Define Bounded Contexts:**
   - Create bounded contexts for each domain. Bounded contexts set the boundaries within which a particular model is defined and applicable. This helps in avoiding ambiguity and conflicts.

4. **Explore Ubiquitous Language:**
   - Establish a common language (Ubiquitous Language) that is shared between developers and domain experts. Use terms and concepts that are understood by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

5. **Model the Domain:**
   - Create domain models for each bounded context. These models should represent the key entities, aggregates, and their relationships. This could involve creating class diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, or other modeling techniques.

6. **Identify Aggregates:**
   - Identify aggregates within each domain. Aggregates are clusters of related entities treated as a single unit. Understanding aggregates helps in defining transactional boundaries.

7. **Study Existing Code:**
   - Dive into the existing codebase. Focus on the parts corresponding to the identified bounded contexts. Look for alignment with the domain models you've defined.

8. **Refactor Code with DDD Principles:**
   - Apply DDD principles such as aggregate design, repository patterns, and value objects to refactor code. Align the code structure with the domain model to improve readability and maintainability.

9. **Communicate with Stakeholders:**
   - Regularly communicate with domain experts and stakeholders to validate your understanding. This iterative process ensures that the codebase continues to align with evolving business requirements.

10. **Iterate and Improve:**
    - Continuously iterate and improve your understanding of the codebase and the domain. Refine the domain models and code as necessary based on feedback and changing requirements.

Remember, applying DDD is an ongoing process. It's about creating a shared understanding of the domain between developers and domain experts and ensuring that the code reflects this understanding accurately.
