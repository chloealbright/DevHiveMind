The main difference between k-way merge and 2-way merge is the number of sorted lists being merged. 

In 2-way merge, two sorted lists are merged into a single sorted list. It's a basic merging operation often used in algorithms like Merge Sort.

On the other hand, k-way merge involves merging k sorted lists into a single sorted list. This generalizes the concept to handle more than two input lists. Algorithms like external sorting or certain types of database query processing may employ k-way merging when dealing with a larger number of sorted datasets.

In summary, 2-way merge deals with two sorted lists, while k-way merge handles k sorted lists.

	-  Dealing with multiple arrays, rows in two-dimensional arrays, or multiple linked lists, where you find the lowest value and store them in order from least to greatest, similar to a min-heap or merge sort.
