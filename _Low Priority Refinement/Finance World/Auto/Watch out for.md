1. You Complain about the Monthly Payment ( and they Bring you lower one by extending the Amount of the time )  

-Not many people know but you can actually get really great rates by going to bank getting pre-approved for a car loan  
  
-Then going to car loan guy without telling them and having him work you on that price as much as possible  
  
-Because in his head there are margins, well if I lower here, I’ll get them on warranty and the car loan cut and so on  
  
He or she (because people can be bad people no matter who they are )  
  
-It’s 30,000 but it’s a good deal, and its only about $566.14 a month only 5% interest  
  
-Now you make about 45k a year and you’re like that to much money for me, to expensive ( he comes back or she ) I spoke to my boss and we got some new terms, how about $424.02 that’s about $100 less and it’s a big difference  
  
-You get a smile from ear to ear and you go with your brand new car  
  
However on the way you realized:  
  
-That its not a good idea to have 66% of your annual income in car  
  
-You also realized that they didn’t help with the price they just extended the years from 5 years to 7 years  
  
-And you never really negotiated anything  
  
  
2. You just got a car like 2-3 years ago ( and now they want you to trade it in )  
  
-You walk in for your normal average oil change or tired rotation, because getting it at the dealship is the best place to get it ( because they are the true house of the car )  
  
-No they just sell the cars, any professional can do the same job just as effectively

-Say you don’t have a trade in  
  
-Pick out your car  
  
-Negotiate the price of the car as low as possible the actual selling price of the car  
  
-Look I want to get out something to eat and come back ( with price in hand )  
  
-Then say you want to trade in the car ( price of the new car, how much they gonna give you for the trade in ) – they will have two factors to negotiate ( good deal on the car but bad trade )  
  
-Know what the trade in value on Kelly Blue book ( so you know the value ) – bring the Info )  
  
  
  
3. Squeezing the last bit of Juice you have left  
  
-Whenever closing the deal on something that’s expensive  
  
-They will offer you Warranties, products, services and whatever it is  
  
-Remember the highest margins aren’t made in the big ticket items its often on the little things  
  
4. My advice  
-Don’t buy a cat more than half your annual income  
-Don’t buy new look for 3-5 years  
-And always pay in cash
