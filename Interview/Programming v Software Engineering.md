## Programming(Micro)

Programming is like giving instructions to a computer to make it do things. Imagine you have a very obedient robot, and you need to tell it what to do step by step. You use a special language (programming language) to write these instructions, and the robot (computer) follows them precisely. These instructions can be anything from making a game, calculating numbers, or even browsing the internet.  
  
## Software Engineering(Macro)
Software engineering is like building a complex structure, but instead of bricks and mortar, you're creating computer programs (software). It involves a structured and organized approach to designing, creating, and maintaining these programs. Just like architects plan buildings, software engineers plan how a program will work, write the code (the instructions for the computer), test it to make sure it works correctly, and keep it updated and running smoothly.  
  
In summary, programming is the act of writing instructions for a computer, while software engineering is the process of designing, building, and maintaining those instructions to create useful and reliable software.
