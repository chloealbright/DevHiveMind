## The Next Job

Relevant maybe look for tech roles in the fintech construction industry or banking industry or edtech industry since have experience in this which can make it easier to find next role


Build project that people can interact with should avoid general login feature people really wouldn't use it 


Make sure to git commit to show something is happening or add something that indicates that work is being done to let recruiters know your doing stuff

Social media might be a good source in terms of system design

## And the Next One 

scenario around explaining something technical to non technical audience  
  

  
  
  
**Talk about moving Fast on your projects and failing fast using that experience on your projects to learn**  
*Basic*
I worked on setting up typescript on a project i was using to track my leetcode it ended being very helpful because I got a deeper understanding of javascript also builds. This also lead to me adding typescript to another more advance project which is a fullstack project i,m building were i,m re-purposing a codebase I worked on by reverse engineering.    

docker project


  
**Tell Me About A Time When The Project Was Ambiguous**  

college doing one project between two classes one team frontend other team backend 

  
**Tell me about a time you had to manage conflicting priorities**

managing bootcamp vs participating in scrum standup
  
**Tell Me About A Time You Had To Learn Something Quickly** 
PowerBI really got back to data base fundamentals and advanced database stuff like different schema I learned that you should create a scope of learning otherwise you can go to far out of scope for you task
  
**Tell Me About A Time A Project Took Longer Than Expected**
Are Docker cohort where were asked to pivot and host the docker cohort sooner then we planned also there was misalignment between leadership and where developers where at because the cohort was tailored towards senior talent and was focused on intermediate  level understanding  there was assumption by leadership that the cohort should be intermediate when the developers required a beginner cohort.

**Tell me about the project that you are most proud of**
Under the wing or Tracflo more metrics to discuss
  
**Tell me about a time you failed or made a mistake or pressure**
Tracflo learning to read a codebase better or being to self dependent learned that is the least efficient approach 



**Tell me about a time you disagreed with someone**
A stakeholder who we worked indirectly with and wasn't really 
  

**Tell Me About A Time You Worked On Something Outside Your OKR meaning Tell me about a time when you went above and beyond.**
my mind map helped carlos with his API project  


  
**Tell Me About A Time You Received Constructive Feedback**

**Tell Me About A Time You Worked With A Difficult Person**

## And the Next One... 
**Highlight personal stats and lead with transferable skills**

So I come from a technical bootcamp background and have experience as a full-stack developer working in the venture capital space at a Series A startup. Additionally, I've worked as a Business Systems Analyst (BSA), where I had the opportunity to plan out bootcamps tailored for diverse developer populations who I supported. so my question is ...



## TD Bank - Business Systems Analyst 

At TD I supported the transition to SAFe(Scaled agile framework) workflow, for both technical and non-technical teams. In agile ceremonies, I collaborated with Product Owners, Scrum Masters, and Stakeholders. Managing Jira tickets and doing backlog refinement for PI planing.

Worked on Data Visualization projects were I created logical data models along creating PowerBI reports for skill matrices that utilize data being pulled in from resume with python script, Also created reports with data collected from upskillings session, along with software developers code commits  

By conducting needs assessments and collaborating with stakeholders, I aligned upskilling initiatives with organizational goals, optimizing resource allocation.

Collaborating with a third-party upskilling firm conducting needs assessments with different population insuring that the upskilling aligned with TD Bank leadership. Besides we upskilled 200+ software engineers across 10 cohorts in Advanced Java, Spring Boot, Docker, Event-Driven Architecture, and Reactive Programming all within a 5 month spanned.

## TracFlo  

I was worked at TracFlo, an series A fintech startup operating within the construction industry with a primary objective to streamline construction projects by digitizing documentation and processes, specifically targeting the elimination of change orders. My role as a full stack developer involved contributing to various features on their new application.

One of my initial tasks was managing the data migration process from the old WordPress app to the new one. I created different migration files using the Knex.js query builder library, focusing on diverse data tables from the old app. This process also involved redefining table relationships to accommodate changes in business logic.

In addition, I worked on multiple endpoints using Typescript interfaces and types, implementing them on an Express server. On the frontend, I utilized React along with technologies such as Redux, React hooks, and props, incorporating libraries like MUI. Specific features included the development of CreateTickets and sub-features like Get all, Create, and Edit for equipment and materials. I also played a key role in defining field definitions for user and labor components and created integration tests for endpoints utilizing Mock Data.

## Under the wing Independent contract project 

I collaborated on a project for the Department of a small business, named Under the Wing, where our focus was an online mentorship platform. As a front-end developer within a team of three, we engaged in crucial project aspects such as defining scope, deliverables, and establishing a robust data model. Our approach followed agile development methodologies.

In terms of technology, I leveraged React, Bootstrap, and various other libraries to craft reusable components. Throughout the development process, I diligently adhered to sprint cycles, ensuring timely and iterative progress. Additionally, I contributed to comprehensive project documentation using Markdown.


## Park Alert 

My favorite project, Park Alert, is a mobile application designed to assist users in finding parking spots. The concept draws inspiration from the Citizen app combined with the convenience of Uber. This endeavor challenged me to engage in thoughtful planning and strategic thinking. I created numerous UML diagrams to map out the system design and its various components.

During the development process, I constructed a mock application utilizing Dart, Flutter, and a map API. The extensive use of diagrams not only enhanced my understanding of the project but also sharpened my skills in whiteboard discussions and code debugging. This project served as a valuable learning experience, requiring me to delve into various technologies, grasp GitHub intricacies, work within a Linux development environment, and draw inspiration from diverse projects to refine my design approach.
