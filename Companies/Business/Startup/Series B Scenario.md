At this point, the company has used the Series A to validate a winning go to market strategy. Now the company needs to scale, face competitors, increase market share. The goal is not necessarily to become profitable although scale should help margins increase. There are the reasons why the company raised a Series B ($10M to $20M) 

Let’s give a final look at the number of employees by round: 

Startups will add approximately 100 employees during this round. As part of the Series B fundraising, the company should have again issued ~5% of stock options. Essentially that means the company will be able to give ~0.05% of its equity to new employees (like in all rounds, that number is subject to change depending on your seniority, experience, and need for your skillset). 

Results: Assuming a 0.05% stake and no further fundraising rounds, had you joined Facebook at that stage, you would own ~$19M at IPO. Had you joined Whatsapp at that stage, at its sale to Facebook, you would own ~$7.5M. Had you joined Instagram at that stage, at it sale to Facebook, you would own ~$375k. Had you joined Mint.com at that stage, at it sale to Intuit, you would own ~$65k.
