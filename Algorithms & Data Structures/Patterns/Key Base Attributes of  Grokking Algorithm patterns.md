## Sliding Window

- **Definition:** Sliding Window is a pattern for efficiently processing arrays or strings by maintaining a "window" of elements.
- **Key Elements:**
  - Input array or string.
  - WindowStart and WindowEnd.
	  - You may check if it is greater than diff between WindowEnd to WindowStart  + 1 
  - Window size conditions to increments and decrements or both.
  - Iteration by array length.
  - Target sum  
- **Potential Problem Goals**
	- You may also leverage min and max other Math methods depending on what you're doing 
	- You may return something like length, minLength, maxLength in terms of window size 
- **Use Cases:**
  - Contiguous sub-arrays or sublists.
  - Finding the smallest, longest, or other subarray.
- **Hints:** 
	- Look for keywords like "contiguous," "subarray," and "sublist."
	- Typically we use all of the elements within the sliding window for the problem like too combine things or do some type of action within window range 
- **Use Sorting:** Sort the input arrays/lists if necessary before applying the Two Pointer technique. 

Two pointer and Sliding window can be interchangeable solution but one would just be more efficient then the other depending on the what the problem solution demands typically pointer is used for comparison while window is used for other action like adding or doing some other action with the elements in the range of the window but not specifically comparison of values.
## Two Pointer

- **Definition:** The Two Pointer pattern involves using two pointers to traverse arrays or strings.
- **Commonalities & Common things to Leverage**
	- Similar attributes to Sliding window 
	- Math methods like min, max, etc...
- **Common Sub Steps:**
	- Iterate through array with while loop with condition of while left is less then right pointer 
	- Maybe swap values 
- **Key Elements:**
  - Input array or string.
  - Left and right pointers.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Comparing values at two pointers.
  - Fast-slow pointer variations.
  - Very useful when dealing with cyclic Linked Lists or Arrays. 
 > [!important]  Used to compare the values at the two pointer instead of all the elements between the pointers. 
- **Use Sorting:** Sort the input arrays/lists if necessary before applying the Two Pointer technique. 

>[!note] Two pointer can be applied to two arrays or strings or a combination of a string and a array or used to find numbers in a range just like Sliding window  

## Fast & Slow Pointers

- **Definition:** Fast & Slow Pointers are a valuable technique used for detecting cycles in linked lists.

## Reversing a Linked List

- **Definition:** Reversing a linked list is a fundamental operation that involves changing the order of elements in a singly linked list. It transforms the list so that the last element becomes the first, and so on, effectively flipping the direction of the list.

  2. Start at the head of the linked list (`current` points to the head).
  3. While `current` is not `null`:
     - Store the next node (`current.next`) in the `next` pointer to prevent losing the rest of the list.
     - Update the `current.next` to point to the previous node (`prev`), effectively reversing the pointer direction.
     - Move the `prev` pointer to the `current` node.
     - Move the `current` pointer to the `next` node.
  4. Once the loop is complete, the `prev` pointer will be pointing to the new head of the reversed list.
  5. Update the head of the original list to the node pointed to by `prev`, making it the head of the reversed list.

- **Use Cases:** Reversing a linked list can be useful in various scenarios, such as optimizing algorithms or solving problems that require elements to be processed in reverse order. It's a foundational operation in data structure manipulation.

### k way merge vs 2-way Merge

The main difference between k-way merge and 2-way merge is the number of sorted lists being merged. 

In 2-way merge, two sorted lists are merged into a single sorted list. It's a basic merging operation often used in algorithms like Merge Sort.

On the other hand, k-way merge involves merging k sorted lists into a single sorted list. This generalizes the concept to handle more than two input lists. Algorithms like external sorting or certain types of database query processing may employ k-way merging when dealing with a larger number of sorted datasets.

#### More use cases
Dealing with multiple arrays, rows in two-dimensional arrays, or multiple linked lists, where you find the lowest value and store them in order from least to greatest, similar to a min-heap or merge sort.

In summary, 2-way merge deals with two sorted lists, while k-way merge handles k sorted lists.
