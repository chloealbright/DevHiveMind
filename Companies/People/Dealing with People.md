Ask for Review instead of asking PL for content generation incentives them to do s***  
  
  
In this case you become the content generator and ask them to review and get pressures them to look at what you made to see how the lines and if it doesn't it makes them act to help fix what you've created in terms of whatever then you're working


You can say no to work depending on the person asking or the scope  
  
  
If work is from PL tell them you have other stuff and you have other things what should I prioritize or should I pass on things
