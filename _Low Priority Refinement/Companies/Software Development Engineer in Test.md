In very simple words, this role is a combination of an intermediate between a pure developer role and a pure tester role. SDETs are skilled professionals in both – Quality Engineering as well as Software Development.  
  
The term SDET was first invented by Microsoft, which was then followed and used by most big Product names like Google, Amazon, Adobe, Expedia, etc. The role’s major expectations were to replace manual repetitive tasks with some automation to increase efficiency as well as reliability for the applications under test.  
  
  
  
Manual QA testers are mainly focused on the Black box or Application testing. What it means is, for a QA tester, what matters is a specification of how an app is expected to behave when given a certain input.  
  
QA tester would just use the Application/System under test as any normal user/customer would use but with a focus on more minute details as well as edge scenarios by trying different input combinations, etc.  
  
SDET’s focuses on applications from both White Box as well as Black Box testing. In other words, they would also be aware of the inner functioning of the app, which enables them to write Automation tests using both White Box and Black Box testing techniques.  
  
In essence, a Software Development Engineer in Test must be aware of all Black Box testing techniques along with hands-on development/coding knowledge to understand the inner functioning of the app which ensures better quality standards as well as a less defective software product.  
  
Essentially, an SDET should act as an enabler for effective QA through any means. What this also means, is that the individual would use his/her skills to ensure all parts of the software under test are validated in the best possible way which should include testing both functional and non-functional areas.  
  
  
In general, SDET interviews consist of the following rounds/question types at almost all big product organizations like – Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe, Expedia, etc.  
  
Written Round: Writing test cases for a given product. Here, the intention is to get an idea of what all facets of testing can the person think about the candidate like if he thinks/lists all functional scenarios, edge-case scenarios, if the candidate focuses on security testing, performance testing, etc.  
Coding Round: A small coding exercise is given and also the candidate is expected to write down all unit testing and functional testing scenarios. Here the area or skill that’s being tested is – basic coding knowledge/constructs, writing testable code, and knowledge about white box testing techniques like Unit testing, Mocking, etc.  
Design Round: A system design question is thrown, for example, how would you design youtube  
These type of questions generally hold more relevance for developers, but for SDETs, the interviewer is looking for how broadly can the person think, does the candidate know about OOPs concepts, is the candidate capable of thinking about scalability, robustness, load balancing, etc, can the candidate use right databases for the application that’s to be designed  
HR/Manager Round: Here things like team fitness, culture fitness, etc are observed about the candidate as well as salary discussions, and negotiations are also done.
