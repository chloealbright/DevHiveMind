Navigating compensation packages can be overwhelming, but considering key factors will help you make an informed decision:

1. **Survivability on Lower Salary:**
   Evaluate if the lower salary aligns with your living expenses, especially in high-cost areas like San Francisco. Understand the trade-off between lower immediate income and potential higher equity stakes in early startups.

2. **Four-Year Plan:**
   If equity follows a four-year vesting schedule, consider how it aligns with your future plans. Factor in major life changes, like moving or going back to school, as these can impact your ability to benefit from the full vesting period.

3. **Belief in the Company:**
   Assess your optimism about the company's future and exit prospects. While predicting these outcomes is challenging, considering them is vital, especially when contemplating a job with lower salary but higher excitement about the company.

4. **Financial Sense of Alternatives:**
   If presented with two packages—one emphasizing equity and the other a higher salary—run calculations to approximate their comparative value. While not foolproof, this provides a ballpark figure for a more informed decision.

5. **Stock Purchase Opportunities:**
   Explore the potential to purchase company shares at a fixed price during your tenure. Understand the timeframe and conditions for acquiring shares, as this can influence your overall compensation strategy.

6. **Base Pay Focus:**
   Prioritize negotiating a higher base pay, particularly in startups, rather than relying heavily on bonuses or equity. This ensures a more stable income and mitigates risks associated with fluctuating bonuses or uncertain equity returns.

In weighing these factors, you can make a well-rounded decision that aligns with your financial goals and career aspirations.
