feedback, defect rates, and team feedback, achieving a 50% reduction in software defects.
## Dev Stuff

- Created Logical data models  which describes all the logical constraints -- including integrity, tables and views -- applied on the stored data.

- Gained insights into  technical infrastructure, including domain access 


- Analyzed key software engineering metrics:
  - Velocity: Measured team productivity.
  - Cycle Time: Evaluated work item completion time.
  - Lead Time: Measured request to completion time.
  - Quality and Comprehensiveness of Testing: Assessed testing effectiveness.
  - Learning Progress: Evaluated skill development.
- Emphasized the importance of considering teamwork, communication, and problem-solving in addition to metrics.
- Provided insights into how these metrics can be used for evaluation.
