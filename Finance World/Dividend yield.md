Dividend yield is a financial ratio used to measure the return on investment (ROI) that an investor receives from owning a particular stock. It indicates the percentage of the stock's price that is paid out to shareholders in the form of dividends.

Dividends are periodic payments made by a company to its shareholders out of its earnings. They represent a share of the company's profits that is distributed to investors. Dividend yield, expressed as a percentage, is calculated by dividing the annual dividend per share by the stock's current market price.

The formula for dividend yield is as follows:

Dividend Yield = (Annual Dividend per Share / Stock Price) * 100

For example, if a stock has an annual dividend per share of $2 and its current market price is $50, the dividend yield would be (2 / 50) * 100 = 4%.

A higher dividend yield indicates a higher return on investment from dividends relative to the stock's price. It is often considered attractive for income-seeking investors who prioritize regular income generation. However, a high dividend yield may also suggest that the stock price has decreased, which can be a sign of potential risks or market conditions.

It's important to note that dividend yield should not be the sole factor considered when making investment decisions. Other factors, such as the company's financial health, growth prospects, and overall market conditions, should also be taken into account to assess the investment's overall potential.




To calculate the amount you will get with a 4% yield, you need to know the initial investment or principal amount. The yield represents the return on the investment.

To calculate the amount, you can use the following formula:

Amount = Principal + (Principal * Yield)

For example, if you have an initial investment of $10,000 and a 4% yield:

Amount = $10,000 + ($10,000 * 0.04) Amount = $10,000 + $400 Amount = $10,400

Therefore, with a 4% yield, you would get $10,400 in total.
