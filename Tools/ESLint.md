A linter, like ESLint in the context of JavaScript programming, is a static code analysis tool that helps identify and report issues, potential errors, and style violations in your source code. Here's what ESLint and similar linters do:  
  
1. **Code Quality and Consistency**: ESLint enforces coding standards and guidelines to ensure that your code is consistent and of high quality. It checks for issues such as indentation, variable naming, and spacing.  
  
2. **Identifying Errors**: ESLint can detect and report potential errors in your code, such as syntax errors or variable references that may lead to runtime issues.  
  
3. **Code Style**: It helps maintain a consistent code style across a project or team. You can define and enforce coding conventions and best practices to make the codebase more readable and maintainable.  
  
4. **Custom Rules**: ESLint is highly configurable, allowing you to define custom rules and specify which rules should be applied to your codebase. This flexibility makes it adaptable to your specific project's needs.  
  
5. **Integration with Build Tools**: ESLint can be integrated into your development workflow and build tools, ensuring that code quality checks are performed automatically during development or in your Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.  
  
6. **Plugin Ecosystem**: ESLint has a wide ecosystem of plugins that extend its capabilities. These plugins can add additional rules or checks for specific libraries, frameworks, or coding practices.  
  
7. **Editor Integration**: Many code editors and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide ESLint integration, highlighting issues directly within your code as you write, which allows for real-time feedback.  
  
8. **Preventing Bugs**: By catching potential issues early in the development process, linters like ESLint can help prevent bugs and improve the overall reliability of your code.  
  
9. **Team Collaboration**: Linters promote consistency across a development team, making it easier for team members to understand and collaborate on code.  
  
ESLint is widely used in the JavaScript ecosystem, but similar linters exist for other programming languages. It plays a crucial role in maintaining code quality, adhering to coding standards, and catching common programming mistakes, ultimately leading to better software development practices and more reliable code.

ESLint is not considered a code coverage tool. ESLint is a linter, which primarily focuses on static code analysis, code style checking, and the identification of potential issues, errors, and violations of coding standards in your source code.
