Ai CV  

Dear [Employer], 

I am writing to apply for the Full-Stack Engineer position at [Company]. As a Full-Stack Engineer with experience in developing and maintaining web and mobile applications, I am confident that I would be a strong fit for this role. 

I recently worked on the product launch of a new application for TracFlo, using a PERN stack within a Linux environment. Over the course of 16 weeks, I built 13+ features that allowed 50+ general contractors and subcontracting companies to manage projects with up to 35+ active users, each with varying roles and permissions. I also worked on a feature that enabled users to create, edit, and get all equipment and materials within a ticket, which averaged 135+ tickets created per company project. 

In my previous position as an independent consultant, I delivered a full-stack web application that enabled students to find professional mentors. Using Node, Express, PostgreSQL, and Docker, I created 15+ reusable and testable components in just eight weeks, 40% ahead of schedule. I also applied the MVC design pattern to increase back-end performance and efficiency by 20%. Additionally, I maintained stable sprint cycles and deliverables using GitHub, enabling an agile development environment that helped our team ship 25% faster. 

As a Full-Stack Engineer Apprentice at CUNY Tech Prep, I developed a mobile application for locating open parking spots throughout city blocks using Dart, Flutter, and the GoogleMaps API. I also designed 5+ UML diagrams to define project scope and software architecture, and built a full-stack web application for gaming enthusiasts to exchange video games online. 

I am excited about the opportunity to bring my skills and experience to [Company] and contribute to its success. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team in more detail. 

Sincerely, [Your Name] [Your Contact Information]





As a software developer, I know that there are many levels of software development, and I know there can be many unknown about development because there are many things to learn including teamwork. I have learned many things, like how the development process can be like a relay race where the work that you put in to a particular feature can be a dependency for another teammates work & the overall codebase future contribution. I also learned where I want to be in the next couple of years which is as a software architect, which is funny because I don’t see myself as a software developer I see myself as more of a Software Carpenter who builds & plans out software. I know I’m the best candidate for this role because of my mindset. I have conquered many obstacles and continue to find the missing pieces of the puzzle in a puzzle box full of blank white pieces, not knowing the bigger picture. I learned a long time ago that everything is hard, but once I get familiar with the problem and become obsessed and immersed. I can confront the unknown and continue to plot forward and tackle the problem. I view software development as high-level problem solving and consider it similar to martial arts because both are disciplines that require discipline. You have to be almost all those things and willing to learn more. And I believe I carry these attributes because I always try to be better by lapping my past self in a race full of obstacles and problems to be solved. 

Add something about teamwork the parts of the body working together  

 I have grown to learn the software development processes is  like a relay race

As a software developer, I know that there are many levels of software development, and I know I’m the best candidate for the role because of my mindset. Which has helped me conquer many obstacles and continue to find the different missing pieces of the puzzle we call software development. I learned a long time ago that everything is hard, but once I get familiar with the problem and become obsessed and immersed. I can confront the unknown and continue to plot forward and tackle the problem. I view software development as high-level problem solving and consider it similar to martial arts because both are disciplines that require discipline. There is a certain level of attention to detail that you need to maintain while being disciplined and learning many skill sets while applying them, and being alert, sharp to avoid punches while trying to hit back or take someone down and in software development, you have to be almost all those things and willing to learn more. And I believe I carry these attributes because I always try to be better by lapping my past self in a race full of obstacles and problems to be solved.

As a software developer, I know that there are many levels to software development, and I know I am the best candidate for the role because of my mindset. Which has helped me conquer many obstacles and continue to find the different missing pieces of the puzzle we call software development. I learned a long time ago that everything is hard, but once I get familiar with the problem and become obsessed and immersed, I can confront the unknown and continue to plot forward towards the problem. Over the years, I have worked with many technologies and am most familiar with JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap creating self-containing, reusable, and testable components. As for the back-end I have worked with technologies like Express.js, Node, PostgreSQL, and Docker while applying MVC design patterns for separation of concerns and business-logic-containment, increasing back-end performance, development, iteration, and debugging efficiency by 20%. I have also worked with OOP & Data Structures & Algorithms Using Java and JavaScript. I’ve also worked with GitHub, RESTful APIs, and asynchronous programming.
