[[Express.js]] is a backend framework for building APIs whereas Next. js is a full stack framework that uses some `Node.js` and builds upon React to improve the [[SEO]], development experience, and performance of your project. One of these features is a built-in API routing system that could replace Express but you can use them together. Side note there are packages in Next.js like Internationalization (i18n) from Next.js for foreign languages.
