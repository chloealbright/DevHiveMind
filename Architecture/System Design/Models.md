State Diagrams

Activity vs. State Machines 

In UML semantics, Activity Diagrams are reducible to State Machines with some additional notations that the vertices represent the carrying out of an activity and the edges represent the transition on the completion of one collection of activities to the commencement of a new collection of activities. 

Activity Diagrams capture high-level activities aspects. In particular, it is possible to represent concurrency and coordination in Activity Diagrams. 

Take a look at the Activity Diagram which models the flow of actions for an incident. Such an Activity Diagram focuses on the flow of data within a system.

Objects have both behavior and state or, in other words, they do things and they know things.

UML state machine diagrams depict the various states that an object may be in and the transitions between those states.  
  
An initial state, also called a creation state, is the one that an object is in when it is first created.  
  
A final state is one in which no transitions lead out of.  
  
A transition is a progression from one state to another and will be triggered by an event that is either internal or external to the object.  
  
Guard, conditions that must be true for the transition to be triggered, are optionally indicated.  
  
Methods to be invoked when the object enters the state are indicated by the keyword entry.  
  
Methods to be invoked as the object exits the state are indicated by the keyword exit.  
  
change names of states like set destination or radius to past tense like destination set or radius setting

Like process flow but more so for business function and mechanism
