a programmer is more technical and specific writing tight code or loose code while a developer some times referred to as an engineer is more abstract working with people on projects connecting things like frameworks and databases making things comes together navigating things like in agile projects but also may be a programmer or coder or maybe just a programmer. a coder can be considered a lower level programmer who works with a specific lower language like HTML and apply the code to something and sometimes they aren't coding as much just putting some things together. The architect's highest level where you get to pick the technologies used.  
  
A beginner is a programmer capable of using the basic capabilities of one language. Such a person can write classes, routines, loops, and conditionals and use many of the features of a language.  
  
  
An intermediate programmer who has moved past the beginner phase is capable of using the basic capabilities of multiple languages and is very comfortable in at least one language.  
  
  
A competent programmer has expertise in a language or an environment or both. A programmer at this level might know all the intricacies of J2EE or have the Annotated C++ Reference Manual memorized. Programmers at this level are valuable to their companies, and many programmers never move beyond this level.  
  
A leader has the expertise of a Level3 programmer and recognizes that programming is only 15 percent communicating with the computer and 85% communicating with people. Only 30% of an average programmer’s time is spent working alone (McCue 1978) Even less time is spent communicating with the computer. The guru writes code for an audience of people rather than machines. True guru-level programmers write code that’s crystal-clear, and they document it, too. They don’t want to waste their valuable gray cells reconstructing the logic of a section of code that they could have read in one-sentence comment.
