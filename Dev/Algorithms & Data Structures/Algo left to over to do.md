# Matrix

# Modified Binary Search pattern

Applying to different Data Structures probably slight syntax change

# Linked list coding problems Object pointer reassignment building blocks for tree and graph nodes reassignment


Build base for resigning pointers will help with graphs & trees


Will help with building Doubly Linked List & Cyclical Doubly Linked List generator function

Also implementing queues with Linked List might want to generate a function for that to


# Heaps > built with Array easiest better implementation

Insert and bubble up are the same thing for heaps and remove is bubble down

# Priority queue > built with Heaps easiest better implementation

# Dynamic Programming what ever else there maybe after Memoize & Tabulation

can vary with data structures used and number of structures used 2 at min or more

# Greedy Algo



# Union Find

Create queue generator method with Linked list and replace bfs queues with that new queue also for priority queue


edit and create other data Structure method generators


# files to edit or look at

priority queue

queue linked list and double linked list
