Dear Company Recruitment, 

After researching your company and its commitment to [Company Value or Goal], I am eager to apply for the Full-Stack Engineer position. With a background in developing and maintaining web applications, as well as supporting fellow software engineers in a Business Systems Analyst (BSA) capacity, I am confident in my ability to excel in this role. I am passionate about the process of strategizing, designing, and constructing data models, coupled with mapping out the functionality of an application. This parallels the way an architect builds a structure based on a meticulously crafted blueprint. This is a key factor in why I identify as a software carpenter, who will become a software architect because I follow this mantra “become better than you were yesterday.”  


As a software developer, I know that there are many levels of software development, and I know I’m the best candidate for the role because of my mindset. Which has helped me conquer many obstacles and continue to find the different missing pieces of the puzzle we call software development. I learned a long time ago that everything is hard, but once I get familiar with the problem and become obsessed and immersed. I can confront the unknown and continue to plot forward and tackle the problem. 




## Entry with Stats

I recently worked on the product launch of a new application for TracFlo, using a PERN stack within a Linux environment. Over the course of 16 weeks, I built 13+ features that allowed 50+ general contractors and subcontracting companies to manage projects with up to 35+ active users, each with varying roles and permissions. I also worked on a feature that enabled users to create, edit, and get all equipment and materials within a ticket, which averaged 135+ tickets created per company project. 


## Entry 2
As a software developer, I know that there are many levels of software development, and I know there can be many unknown about development because there are many things to learn including teamwork. I have learned many things, like how the development process can be like a relay race where the work that you put in to a particular feature can be a dependency for another teammates work & the overall codebase future contribution. I also learned where I want to be in the next couple of years which is as a software architect, which is funny because I don’t see myself as a software developer I see myself as more of a Software Carpenter who builds & plans out software. I know I’m the best candidate for this role because of my mindset. I have conquered many obstacles and continue to find the missing pieces of the puzzle in a puzzle box full of blank white pieces, not knowing the bigger picture. I learned a long time ago that everything is hard, but once I get familiar with the problem and become obsessed and immersed. I can confront the unknown and continue to plot forward and tackle the problem. I view software development as high-level problem solving and consider it similar to martial arts because both are disciplines that require discipline. You have to be almost all those things and willing to learn more. And I believe I carry these attributes because I always try to be better by lapping my past self in a race full of obstacles and problems to be solved. 

Add something about teamwork the parts of the body working together  


## Path with Stats
In my previous position as an 


at TD, I successfully facilitated the adoption of the SAFe workflow across technical and non-technical teams, resulting in a 12% increase in SAFe adoption organization-wide. Collaborating closely with stakeholders, I strategically planned and implemented each phase of the process, ensuring a seamless transition. I have actively participated in agile ceremonies, including Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, contributing to enhanced team productivity and collaboration.

Utilizing my expertise in data analysis, I built logical data models with PowerBI, incorporating key software engineering metrics such as velocity, cycle time, and lead time. This allowed me to identify trends and patterns in technology, contributing to informed decision-making.

Furthermore, I collaborated with a third-party upskilling firm to develop and implement an internal upskilling pilot program. This involved supporting software engineers in setting up WSL along with Docker and resulted in upskilling over 200+ software engineers across 10 cohorts in a span of 5 months, covering Advanced Java, Spring Boot, Docker, Event-Driven Architecture, and Reactive Programming.


independent consultant, I delivered a full-stack web application that enabled students to find professional mentors. Using Node, Express, PostgreSQL, and Docker, I created 15+ reusable and testable components in just eight weeks, 40% ahead of schedule. I also applied the MVC design pattern to increase back-end performance and efficiency by 20%. Additionally, I maintained stable sprint cycles and deliverables using GitHub, enabling an agile development environment that helped our team ship 25% faster. 

As a Full-Stack Engineer Apprentice at CUNY Tech Prep, I developed a mobile application for locating open parking spots throughout city blocks using Dart, Flutter, and the GoogleMaps API. I also designed 5+ UML diagrams to define project scope and software architecture, and built a full-stack web application for gaming enthusiasts to exchange video games online. 




## path 1
I view software development as high-level problem solving and consider it similar to martial arts because both are disciplines that require discipline. There is a certain level of attention to detail that you need to maintain while being disciplined and learning many skill sets while applying them, and being alert, sharp to avoid punches while trying to hit back or take someone down and in software development, you have to be almost all those things and willing to learn more. And I believe I carry these attributes because I always try to be better by lapping my past self in a race full of obstacles and problems to be solved. 

## path 2 
Over the years, I have worked with many technologies and am most familiar with JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap creating self-containing, reusable, and testable components. As for the back-end I have worked with technologies like Express.js, Node, PostgreSQL, and Docker while applying MVC design patterns for separation of concerns and business-logic-containment, increasing back-end performance, development, iteration, and debugging efficiency by 20%. I have also worked with OOP & Data Structures & Algorithms Using Java and JavaScript. I’ve also worked with GitHub, RESTful APIs, and asynchronous programming.
