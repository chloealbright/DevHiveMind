## Programming vs Software Engineering

### Programming (Micro)

- A programmer focuses on writing specific, technical code, which can be either concise or more verbose.
- Developers, often referred to as engineers, work on projects, connecting various components like frameworks and databases to create a cohesive solution.
- They collaborate with teams, navigate agile project methodologies, and may also write code or be primarily programmers.
- Coders, a level below programmers, work with lower-level languages like HTML, applying code and assembling components, not necessarily writing extensive code.
- Architects, at the highest level, make technology choices and architectural decisions.

Programming is akin to giving step-by-step instructions to a computer, much like instructing an obedient robot. It involves using a specific language (programming language) to write these instructions, which the computer follows precisely. These instructions can encompass tasks like creating games, performing calculations, or browsing the internet.

### Software Engineering (Macro)

Software engineering is comparable to constructing complex structures, but instead of using bricks and mortar, you are creating computer programs (software). It requires a structured and organized approach to designing, developing, and maintaining software. Just as architects plan physical buildings, software engineers plan how a program will function, write the code (instructions for the computer), test it for correctness, and ensure it runs smoothly and stays up to date.

# Levels of Proficiency

## Level 1

- A beginner programmer is proficient in the basics of one programming language.
- They can write classes, routines, loops, conditionals, and use many language features.
- Level 1 topics may not require extensive testing initially. Instead, start by identifying problem areas and focusing on studying and researching those specific areas.

## Level 2

- An intermediate programmer is comfortable with the basics of multiple languages and very proficient in at least one.
- Level 2 topics require a balance between research and testing. Identify problem areas, research, test, study solutions, and emphasize doing questions to advance to level 3.

## Level 3

- A competent programmer possesses expertise in a language or environment.
- They have comprehensive knowledge and should focus on practice, testing, reviewing solutions, and refining expertise.

## Changing Levels

Be flexible with your level assessments. If you see improvement, move to a higher level. If a topic becomes challenging or your solutions are suboptimal, move it down a level. Adapt your approach as needed.

In summary, for effective learning, assess your proficiency objectively and adjust your study approach accordingly. When learning a concept in English, plan and understand it thoroughly before translating it into code.

A leader in programming has the expertise of a Level 3 programmer and understands that programming is about 15% communicating with the computer and 85% communicating with people. Even though a significant portion of an average programmer's time is not spent working alone, the guru-level programmer writes code for human understanding. They produce clear, well-documented code to save time and make their logic easily accessible.
