Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is an extension of Test Driven Development (TDD). In BDD, we are writing scenarios from the end user’s perspective. 

BDD has two sides: 

1.  The Business side: Feature files where we use the Gherkin language to write our scenarios. Gherkin is similar to English syntax, so everyone on the team is on the same page. 
    
2.  The Implementation side: Where we implement the programming logic that automates the application.
