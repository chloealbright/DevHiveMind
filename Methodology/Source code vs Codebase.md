"Source code" and "codebase" are related terms in software development, but they refer to slightly different concepts.

## Source Code
Source code refers to the human-readable version of a computer program written in a programming language. It consists of the instructions and statements that programmers write to create software. Source code is what developers work with directly when writing, modifying, or debugging a program. It's essentially the text-based representation of the program's logic and functionality. Source code can be saved in files with specific extensions like .cpp for C++ or .py for Python.

## Codebase
A codebase, on the other hand, is a broader term that encompasses all the source code, along with other related files and resources, that make up a software project. It includes not only the source code files but also configuration files, documentation, build scripts, assets, libraries, and any other necessary components. The codebase represents the entire foundation of a software project, including all the tools and resources needed to build, run, and maintain the application.

In summary, source code is the specific textual representation of a program's logic, while a codebase is the entire collection of resources that comprise a software project, including source code, documentation, and various other files.
