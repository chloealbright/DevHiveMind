Algorithmic patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in algorithm design. They often involve specific techniques or strategies that can be applied to various scenarios. These patterns are abstracted from specific implementations, allowing for versatility in solving different problems.

The relationship between algorithm patterns and abstractions lies in the ability to conceptualize and generalize solutions. Abstractions help distill the essence of a problem or solution, making it easier to apply a pattern across different contexts. For example, the "sliding window" pattern abstracts the idea of maintaining a dynamic window of elements in a sequence, enabling efficient solutions to problems like substring search or maximum subarray sum.

The visual names associated with algorithm patterns often describe the high-level strategy used. In the case of "sliding window," the metaphor suggests a window moving over a sequence of elements, highlighting a certain portion at a time. This visual representation helps in understanding and remembering the underlying approach when solving problems that align with this pattern. Other examples of visual names include "divide and conquer," "greedy algorithms," and "backtracking."

In essence, algorithm patterns, abstractions, and visual names work together to create a shared language and understanding among algorithm designers, making it easier to communicate and apply effective solutions to a wide range of problems.


  
1. **Greedy Approach:**  
- **Visual Abstraction:** Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step.  
- **Applicability:** This pattern can be applied to various problems like finding the shortest path, scheduling tasks, and Huffman coding. The visual concept of making the best immediate choice is adaptable to different scenarios.  
  
2. **Divide and Conquer Pattern:**  
- **Visual Abstraction:** Break down a problem into smaller sub-problems, solve them, and combine the solutions.  
- **Applicability:** This pattern is seen in algorithms like Merge Sort and Binary Search. The visual abstraction of dividing and conquering is applicable to problems spanning different data structures.  
  
3. **Dynamic Programming Pattern:**  
- **Visual Abstraction:** Solve a problem by breaking it down into overlapping sub-problems, solving each only once, and storing the solutions for reuse.  
- **Applicability:** Dynamic programming can be applied to problems involving optimization and repeated substructure, such as the knapsack problem or calculating Fibonacci numbers. The visual concept of storing and reusing solutions extends to multiple data structures.  
  
4. **Backtracking Pattern:**  
- **Visual Abstraction:** Systematically explore all possibilities by making choices and undoing them when necessary.  
- **Applicability:** Backtracking is employed in problems like generating permutations, solving puzzles, and constraint satisfaction. The visual representation of exploring and backtracking is flexible and can be adapted to various contexts.  
  
These patterns provide a conceptual framework that can be applied across different data structures (arrays, trees, graphs) and primitive types. The visual abstractions serve as mental models, allowing programmers to approach diverse problems with a common understanding. This adaptability is key to the versatility of algorithmic patterns in solving a wide range of computational challenges.
