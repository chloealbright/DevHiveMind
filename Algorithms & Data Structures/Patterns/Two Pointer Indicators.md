When dealing with problems that involve the Two-Pointer technique, certain keywords or phrases might indicate its applicability. Look out for:

1. **Two Pointers:**
   - Of course, the most direct clue is the mention of "two pointers" in the problem description or prompt.

2. **Pairs of Elements:**
   - If the problem involves finding pairs of elements or comparing elements in a specific way, two pointers might be applicable.

3. **Sum/Target Value:**
   - Phrases like "find a pair with a given sum" or "find elements that add up to a target" often suggest the use of two pointers.

4. **Sorted Array/List:**
   - When the problem mentions that the input is sorted, it's a strong indicator that two pointers could be useful.

5. **Intersection of Arrays:**
   - If the problem involves finding the common elements between two arrays, using two pointers on sorted arrays can be effective.

6. **Closest/Smallest/Difference:**
   - Keywords like "closest pair," "smallest difference," or "minimum absolute difference" might indicate a two-pointer approach.

7. **Cycle Detection:**
   - In problems related to cycle detection, especially in linked lists, two pointers moving at different speeds might be involved.

8. **Longest Subarray/Subsequence:**
   - If the problem asks for the longest subarray or subsequence with a certain property, two pointers might be useful.

9. **Removing Duplicates:**
   - If the task involves removing duplicates from a sorted array or list, you could consider using two pointers.

10. **Trapping Rain Water:**
    - Problems that ask for calculating the amount of trapped rainwater often lend themselves to a two-pointer solution.

11. **Moving Towards Middle:**
    - If the problem involves narrowing down a range or searching for an element within a certain range, two pointers might converge towards the middle.

12. **Palindrome Checking:**
    - When the task involves checking whether a string or array is a palindrome, two pointers on both ends are often useful.

Remember that these indicators are not exhaustive, and the best way to confirm the suitability of the two-pointer technique is to analyze the problem and identify patterns that align with the characteristics of this approach.
