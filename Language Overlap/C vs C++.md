C is renowned for its high performance, closely aligned with low-level languages, albeit less readable than high-level counterparts like Python. Despite lacking classes, C operates as a functional language, playing a crucial role in operating system development.

To deepen your understanding of computing, explore topics such as data representation, digital logic design, Boolean algebra, computer arithmetic, floating-point representation, and cache design. Engage in C and Assembly programming to enhance practical skills.

Discussions on C's dominance often focus on its historical simplicity for system development, especially in kernel-level programming. While C++ has its pros and cons, C's prevalence in applications is rooted in historical conventions. Notably, the Linux kernel is written in C, contributing to its sustained relevance.

C++, a superset of C, incorporates C's foundation. In the C vs C++ debate, both find extensive use in systems programming. C++ can be more challenging to read but offers rich libraries, while C excels in providing close control over hardware, and C++ emphasizes object-oriented programming.
