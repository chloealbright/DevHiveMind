In Part 1 of the series, we will explore architectural patterns, including monolithic and microservices architecture, load balancing and reverse proxies. We will also delve into the world of databases, discussing the differences between relational and NoSQL databases. Toward the end, we discuss Communication methodologies and basic Design Pattern principles.

In [Part 2](https://aruva.medium.com/software-design-fundamentals-in-2023-essential-concepts-for-modern-software-developers-part-ii-b3d3af942088), we will focus on programming principles like SOLID. We will also discuss software development methodologies like Agile, Scrum, DevOps, Version Control systems, Testing and Quality Assurance, Test Driven Development (TDD), and continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

Finally, in [Part 3](https://aruva.medium.com/software-design-fundamentals-in-2023-essential-concepts-for-modern-software-developers-part-iii-87a342ac9a0a), we will dive into virtualization and containerization, Cloud Computing and discuss basic concepts like Iaas, PaaS and SaaS, Authentication Patterns — OAuth and OIDC; anatomy of a JWT token before discussing Web Security principles around cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL Injection and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). We will also discuss the basics of HTTPS and SSL/TLS, followed by Performance Optimization techniques like Caching, Load Balancing, Compression and CDN, providing a wholesome view of an enterprise-grade software solution.

Throughout this series, we will provide diagrams and code snippets to illustrate the concepts and help you understand their practical applications in software development projects.

N**ote: Our intention here is to provide basic terminology and concept overview, which we believe every Software Developer should know. We deliberately do not dive deep into any of the topics. The code snippets and diagrams should be understandable to developers from all backgrounds and are more focused on delivering the concept than the coding standard / and coding best practices.**

So grab a coffee, and let’s get started.

## 1\. Proxies

Proxies are intermediary servers that stand between clients and other servers. They play a critical role in enhancing performance, security, and reliability in various network scenarios.

## 1.1 Forward Proxy

A forward proxy is a server that acts on behalf of clients to make requests to other servers. Forward proxies can be used for various purposes, such as providing anonymity, enforcing security policies, and caching content.

## 1.2 Reverse Proxy

A reverse proxy is a server that handles client requests on behalf of other servers. Reverse proxies can provide load balancing, SSL termination, and content caching, among other benefits.

## 2\. Architectural Patterns

Architectural patterns are high-level design patterns that define how software components should be organized to achieve specific goals, such as scalability and maintainability.

Monolith vs Microservices

## 2.1 Monolithic Architecture

A monolithic architecture is a software design pattern where all application components are bundled into a single unit. This approach can simplify development and deployment but may hinder scalability and maintainability as the application grows.

A simple monolith implementation in Python

```python

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify  
  
app = Flask(__name__)  
  
@app.route('/api/users', methods=['GET'])  
def get_users():  
    # Retrieve user data from the database  
    pass  
  
@app.route('/api/orders', methods=['POST'])  
def create_order():  
    # Create a new order and store it in the database  
    pass  
  
@app.route('/api/products', methods=['GET'])  
def get_products():  
    # Retrieve product data from the database  
    pass  
  
if __name__ == '__main__':  
    app.run()

```

## 2.2 Microservices Architecture

A microservices architecture is a software design pattern where an application is decomposed into small, loosely-coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

Microservices implementation in Python

```python
# User service  
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify  
  
app = Flask(__name__)  
  
@app.route('/api/users', methods=['GET'])  
def get_users():  
    # Retrieve user data from the database  
    pass  
  
if __name__ == '__main__':  
    app.run(port=5001)
```

```python
# Order service  
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify  
  
app = Flask(__name__)  
  
@app.route('/api/orders', methods=['POST'])  
def create_order():  
    # Create a new order and store it in the database  
    pass  
  
if __name__ == '__main__':  
    app.run(port=5002)
```

## 3\. Databases

Databases are crucial components of many software applications that store, organize, and retrieve data.

## 3.1 Relational Databases

Relational databases use a schema to define tables and the relationships between them. They are based on the relational model, emphasizing data consistency and integrity.

and simple query examples

```sql
-- INSERT
INSERT INTO customers (first_name, last_name, email)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');

-- UPDATE
UPDATE customers
SET email = 'john.doe_updated@example.com'
WHERE id = 1;

-- DELETE
DELETE FROM customers
WHERE id = 1;>)](<-- SELECT
SELECT * FROM customers;

-- INSERT
INSERT INTO customers (first_name, last_name, email)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');

-- UPDATE
UPDATE customers
SET email = 'john.doe_updated@example.com'
WHERE id = 1;

-- DELETE
DELETE FROM customers
WHERE id = 1;>)
```


## 5\. Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that arise during software design. These patterns provide a generalized framework to address specific design challenges and can be adapted to fit the requirements of individual applications. They help developers create modular, scalable, and maintainable code by providing best practices for structuring and organizing software components.

Design patterns can be classified into three main categories:

## 5.1. Creational Patterns:

These patterns deal with the process of object creation. They abstract the instantiation process, making it more flexible, reusable, and maintainable. Examples of creational designs include Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype.

## 5.2. Structural Patterns:

Structural patterns are concerned with the composition of classes and objects. They help assemble individual components into a larger structure, making it easiemanaging relationships and dependencies between objects. Struct easierural patterns include Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, and Proxy.

## 5.3. Behavioral Patterns:

Behavioural patterns define how objects communicate and interact with each other. They help streamline complex communication flows and improve the flexibility and reusability of code by encapsulating behaviour. Examples of behavioural patterns include Observer, Iterator, Strategy, Command, Chain of Responsibility, State, Template Method, Mediator, and Memento.

**A. Singleton**  
A creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

Singleton Pattern

```python
class Singleton:  
    _instance = None  
        def __new__(cls):  
        if cls._instance is None:  
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)  
        return cls._instance  
  
singleton1 = Singleton()  
singleton2 = Singleton()  
print(singleton1 is singleton2)  # Output: True
```

**B. Factory Method**  
A creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be made.

Factory Pattern

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod  
class Creator(ABC):  
    @abstractmethod  
    def factory_method(self):  
        pass  
class ConcreteCreator(Creator):  
    def factory_method(self):  
        return ConcreteProduct()  
class Product(ABC):  
    @abstractmethod  
    def operation(self):  
        pass  
class ConcreteProduct(Product):  
    def operation(self):  
        return "ConcreteProduct"  
creator = ConcreteCreator()  
product = creator.factory_method()  
print(product.operation())  # Output: ConcreteProduct

```

**C. Observer**  
A behavioural design pattern that allows objects to notify other things about changes in their state without being tightly coupled.

Observer pattern

Simple observer pattern implementation in Python

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod  
class Subject(ABC):  
    def __init__(self):  
        self._observers = []  
    def attach(self, observer):  
        self._observers.append(observer)  
    def detach(self, observer):  
        self._observers.remove(observer)  
    def notify(self):  
        for observer in self._observers:  
            observer.update(self)  
  
class ConcreteSubject(Subject):  
    _state = None  
    @property  
    def state(self):  
        return self._state  
    @state.setter  
    def state(self, value):  
        self._state = value  
        self.notify()  
  
class Observer(ABC):  
    @abstractmethod  
    def update(self, subject):  
        pass  
  
class ConcreteObserver(Observer):  
    def update(self, subject):  
        print(f"ConcreteObserver: {subject.state}")  
  
subject = ConcreteSubject()  
observer = ConcreteObserver()  
subject.attach(observer)  
  
subject.state = "New State"  # Output: ConcreteObserver: New State

```
