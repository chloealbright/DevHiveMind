### ‚ùå Avoid  
Don't interrupting your interviewer when they are talking. Usually, if they speak, they are trying to give you hints or steer you in the right direction.  

### ü§å Tactics  
Be thoughtful with your questions, don't ask too many especially since you have limited time.  

Ask the interviewer to restate the question or repeat the question back at the interviewer this gives you time to think  

Between questions and writing code ask if you can get a minute to think in silence by saying ok interesting can I have a little time like 45-sec.

If stuck, think about related problems you have seen before and how they were solved.  


### ‚òùÔ∏èTip  
Avoid rewriting pseudocode that is repeating what is already known  

If you have to explain a lot of stuff and steps about your code you should probably change your approach 

Keep in mind: A lot of interviews ask questions that you won‚Äôt be able to fully answer on time. 

So think: What can I show in order to show that I can do this and I am better than other coders.  

Always get confirmation from the interviewer  

Be honest about what you don't know and know on the interview but attempt problem first and say you haven't seen a problem like this ... to continue the conversation  

## Approach Process  
Talk a little about the Bruteforce approach even if you aren't implementing it

Then transition into talking about the Na√Øve approach or go straight into talking about Optimal approach while whiteboard things out a little and writing things down.  

You don't need to code everything if you can mention there might be a cleaner or better way to make it more readable or optimal by refactoring certain parts you could just talk about that. 

	  

## Algo tip  

1. **Code Review Perspective:**
   - Review your code as if it's written by someone else, and consider potential mistakes and vulnerabilities.

2. **Error Checks:**
   - Think about potential errors and test your code against various inputs.
   - Comment your intended error checks and mention the need for thorough testing.

3. **Darth Vader Principle:**
   - Assume malicious input; safeguard your code against intentional misuse.

4. **Test Coverage:**
   - Test with various scenarios: no params, 0, undefined, null, large arrays, and asynchronous code.

5. **Recursion and Loops:**
   - Consider recursion nested in loops for certain scenarios. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of recursion and loops, discussing their Big O implications.

6. **Regex and Documentation:**
   - Utilize regex and refer to documentation for method syntax, especially when dealing with complex parameters.

7. **Array Iteration:**
   - Prefer `map` over `forEach` for array operations. Avoid modifying objects directly.


## End  
After coding a naive approach. (your first naive approach might be Greedy/Optimal sometimes if your very good still do a naive to explain your process) and go step by step 

Talk about the overall runtime and space complexity of your code.  

Explain trade-offs and how the code/approach can be improved if given more time.  

Ask questions. More importantly, ask good and engaging questions that are tailored to the company! Pick some questions from your list.  

## Situations  
If an interview will give you a harder question after you answer a question that's good they trying to see how high level are you  

If you go to another interview and they give you something unexpected to talk about tell them you didn't expect it and ask for another time to try so you can recenter if the interview is behavioral
