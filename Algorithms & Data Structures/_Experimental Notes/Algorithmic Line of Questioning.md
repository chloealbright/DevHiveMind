## Interrogative pronoun

1. What is the goal or requirement for the pairs of songs?
2. Specifically, what does it mean for a pair's total duration to be divisible by 60?
3. Can you explain the significance of the condition `(time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0`?
4. Are there any additional constraints or considerations for the input list of song durations?
5. Could you provide an example of how the modulo operation ensures divisibility by 60 in this context?

Certainly! Here are a couple more clarifying questions that start with "what":

1. What is the range of values for the elements in the 'time' list?
2. What should be the output if there are no pairs that satisfy the condition?
3. What does it mean for i < j in the context of this problem?
4. What is the expected behavior if there are duplicate durations in the 'time' list?
5. What would be the time complexity requirement for the solution?

Certainly! Here are a few more clarifying questions starting with "what":


2. What happens if the input list is empty?

4. What would be an example of an invalid pair of songs in this context?
5. What role does the constraint "1 <= time[i] <= 500" play in solving the problem?


## Interrogative adverbs:

Certainly! Here are some clarifying questions using interrogative adverbs:

1. **How:** How does the algorithm determine if the total duration is divisible by 60?
2. **Where:** Where in the algorithm is the check for divisibility implemented?
3. **When:** When should the algorithm handle cases where the input list is empty?
4. **Why:** Why is it necessary to have the condition "i < j" in the problem statement?
5. **To what degree:** To what degree should the algorithm prioritize efficiency or simplicity?
6. **Under what circumstances:** Under what circumstances might the given constraints impact the algorithm's design?
7. **In what manner:** In what manner does the algorithm account for duplicate song durations?
8. **For what reason:** For what reason is the modulo operation specifically used for divisibility checking?

Certainly! Here are more clarifying questions using interrogative adverbs:

1. **In what way:** In what way does the algorithm handle edge cases or exceptions?
2. **By what means:** By what means does the algorithm track or store information about valid pairs?
3. **To what extent:** To what extent does the order of elements in the 'time' list affect the algorithm's outcome?
4. **In what situation:** In what situation would the algorithm need to be adjusted for scalability?
5. **Under what conditions:** Under what conditions would the total duration not be considered divisible by 60?
6. **At what point:** At what point in the algorithm is the divisibility check applied to pairs of song durations?
7. **For what purpose:** For what purpose is the constraint "1 <= time[i] <= 500" set in the problem?
8. **By what criteria:** By what criteria does the algorithm identify and count valid pairs?

Certainly, here are more clarifying questions using interrogative adverbs:

1. **By what method:** By what method does the algorithm handle situations where there are multiple valid pairs with the same total duration?
2. **Under what scenario:** Under what scenario should the algorithm prioritize optimizing for memory usage over computational speed?
3. **In what sequence:** In what sequence does the algorithm iterate through the elements of the 'time' list?
4. **In what fashion:** In what fashion does the algorithm account for the possibility of negative durations in the 'time' list?
5. **At what frequency:** At what frequency does the algorithm need to perform the divisibility check for each pair of song durations?
6. **With what outcome:** With what outcome should the algorithm terminate if there is an error or unexpected input?
7. **By what standard:** By what standard is the success of the algorithm measured, and what constitutes a correct solution?
8. **For what reason:** For what reason might the algorithm need to be adapted for use with extremely large input lists?
