1. **Understanding Toil:**
   - Toil encompasses manual, repetitive, and automatable tasks tied to running a production service.
   - It is tactical, lacks enduring value, and scales linearly with service growth.

2. **Assessing Technical Debt:**
   - Inquire about how the company addresses fires and developer toil associated with technical debt.
   - A positive sign is active managerial involvement in reducing developer toil, allocating resources to address specific debt.

3. **Time-Off Culture:**
   - Ask about the average duration of time off employees take.
   - Gauge the response to personal preferences, like expressing an interest in travel, to assess the company's attitude towards work-life balance.
   - Only do crunch if it is rare and isn't happening all the time and you're not in an actual toxic environment.

4. **Managerial Support for Time Off:**
   - Highlight the importance of a manager who encourages time off.
   - Caution about potential red flags, such as manager approval for time off at companies with "unlimited PTO," as it may impede actual vacation opportunities.

5. **Reward Systems:**
   - Probe how the company recognizes and rewards good engineers.
   - Identify whether the managerial approach aligns with retaining skilled professionals.

6. **Addressing Engineer Retention:**
   - Acknowledge that good engineers may have shorter tenures.
   - Monitor if there's a pattern of simultaneous departures among talented individuals, which could impact team morale.


**Note:** These insights aim to help evaluate work environments, managerial attitudes, and cultural aspects to make informed decisions about job opportunities.
