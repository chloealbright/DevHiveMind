This class diagram represents the key entities and their relationships in the driving school system. The driving school administrator, instructor, and student are depicted as separate classes. The administrator class has attributes like username and password, while the instructor class has an additional attribute, instructorId. The student class has attributes like studentId and name.

The administrator class has methods such as login(), addInstructor(), addCurriculum(), and scheduleClass(). The instructor class has methods like login(), viewSchedule(), conductLesson(), and teachDefensiveDriving(). The student class has methods like login(), viewSchedule(), and enrollInCourse().

There are additional classes representing the curriculum, lesson, and schedule. The curriculum class has attributes like curriculumId and name, and methods such as createCurriculum(), updateCurriculum(), deleteCurriculum(), and getCurriculum(). The lesson class has attributes like lessonId, title, description, and instructorId, and methods such as createLesson(), updateLesson(), deleteLesson(), and getLesson(). The schedule class has attributes like scheduleId, date, time, and lessonId, and methods such as createSchedule(), updateSchedule(), deleteSchedule(), and getSchedule()

.

This class diagram provides an overview of the entities involved in the driving school system and their relationships. It serves as a foundation for understanding the system's structure and can be used as a starting point for further development and implementation.
