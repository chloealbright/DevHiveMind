### Simple Test Cases:
- Simple test cases are designed to test the most common and straightforward scenarios of a software application.
- They typically cover typical user interactions and expected behaviors.
- These test cases are often used to verify that the software functions as intended under standard conditions.
- Simple test cases may not always uncover subtle or rare issues in the software.

### Base Test Cases:
- Base test cases are the most straightforward inputs and expected outputs for a problem.
- Focus on these first to ensure your code handles the fundamental requirements correctly.


**While "base test cases" and "simple test cases" may seem similar, there is a subtle difference in their focus:**

1. Base Test Cases:
    - Base test cases refer to a set of [[Test Cases]] that cover the fundamental and essential functionality of a software application.
    - They encompass a broader range of scenarios, including both common and complex use cases.
    - Base test cases are designed to ensure that the core features of the software work correctly and that the application functions as expected under standard conditions.
    - These test cases may involve various combinations of inputs and interactions.

2. Simple Test Cases:
    - Simple test cases, on the other hand, specifically focus on testing the most straightforward and common scenarios of an application.
    - They typically cover the most basic use cases and are often used to verify that the software behaves as expected under typical or everyday conditions.
    - Simple test cases are less likely to explore complex or edge scenarios and instead aim to validate that the software meets basic requirements for common user interactions.

In summary, the key difference between the two lies in their scope. Base test cases encompass a wider range of scenarios, including both common and more complex situations, while simple test cases concentrate on the most basic and everyday interactions with the software. The terminology used may vary depending on the testing process and the specific testing objectives of an organization.
