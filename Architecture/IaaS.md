As a cloud model, IaaS uses virtualization to deliver cloud infrastructure including servers, network, storage, and operating systems (OS). IaaS is often considered the most flexible cloud computing model as it gives users complete control over all infrastructure aspects. This is made possible mostly with the use of dashboards and APIs.  

Contrary to the other two models, IaaS users are required to manage many infrastructure aspects—applications, data, runtimes, middleware, and OS—while the provider manages servers, storage, networking, as well as visualization layers.  

##  IaaS characteristics 

The main characteristics of IaaS include: 

-   Flexibility: gives you more options to deal with future, yet unknown challenges and decisions.  
    
-   Highly scalable services: mitigates resource utilization and stability issues with clean abstraction and tooling (CLI, SDK, API, etc.). 
    
-   Consumption-dependent costs: IaaS is a pay-as-you-go service and shifts the budget from building an on-premise infrastructure to innovation and business operations. 
    
-   User maintains control of the infrastructure: identity and access management (IAM) and security remain at the hands of the end-user, not the vendor. 
    
-   Resources are available as a service: IaaS provides basic blocks of computing power, for example, CPU, memory, and storage—all of them living in a geographic perimeter. 
    

##  IaaS advantages 

IaaS is a cloud model that has a lot to offer. Some of its advantages are: 

-   No need to invest in expensive infrastructure—are resources provided by the vendor. 
    
-   It’s highly scalable. 
    
-   It’s a pay-as-you-go service that makes it easy for the end-user to purchase resources, scale, or downsize depending on business needs. 
    

##  IaaS disadvantages 

IaaS brings a nice set of pros but there are definitely some cons that need to be addressed. 

-   **Security** . While it surely is an advantage for the user to be able to maintain control over the infrastructure, there are a number of security threats that can still creep in from the host or other virtual machines (VM). The fact that multiple clients are using one piece of hardware also raises some security concerns. Users rely on the vendor to make sure all VMs are properly isolated. 
    
-   **Unpredictable costs**. Sure, the highly scalable nature of IaaS is most certainly a desirable feature but it can also cause problems if instances are not monitored properly and shut down when not needed. If your organization does not have a cloud engineer or FinOps engineer, these mistakes are more likely to happen. 
    
-   **Training**. Managing cloud infrastructure is no walk in the park. One common mistake to make is thinking that IaaS is the same thing as managing servers on-prem. It’s not the same job, and the skills required are not the same. You need to keep in mind that your staff may need additional training in order to effectively manage the infrastructure. Otherwise, there is the risk of making important mistakes when designing or operating cloud infrastructure: downtime, performance issues, crazy bills, frustration, etc. 
    

##  Infrastructure as a Service 

-   IaaS is the most versatile model and it’s a great option for startups and SMEs.  
    
-   Gives a high level of control over the infrastructure, a feature that can be highly appreciated and utilized by big enterprises.  
    
-   Its level of customization makes this model an excellent choice for creating highly customizable apps. 
    
-   Its scalability also brings great advantages for organizations experiencing hyper-growth.
