The term "artifact" in the context of Maven specifically refers to the individual software components, libraries, or files stored in a Maven repository. These artifacts, commonly in the form of JAR (Java Archive) files, contain compiled code, resources, and other necessary elements for a project. The identification of each artifact involves coordinates such as Group ID, Artifact ID, Version, and sometimes a Packaging type.

In a deployment context, the term "artifact" might still refer to deployable units, but the nature of these artifacts can vary based on the technology stack and deployment strategy. While Maven artifacts are primarily associated with Java projects and might include JAR files, in a broader deployment context, artifacts could encompass a wider range of file types.

For instance, in a web development context, artifacts could be compiled JavaScript files, CSS stylesheets, and HTML templates bundled together. In a containerized deployment using technologies like Docker, artifacts might refer to Docker images containing the application and its dependencies.

So, while the core concept of artifacts remains consistent in the sense of deployable units, the specific type and format of artifacts can vary across different technologies and deployment scenarios.
