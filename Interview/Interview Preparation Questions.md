    -   Browser sends the HTTP/HTTPS request to the server 
        
    -   Server checks the request against middleware 
        
    -   If Middleware checks pass, server processes the request and sends back a response 
        
    -   Browser renders the content of the web page

-   What is your favorite piece of technology and why? 
    
-   How would you describe <technology> to someone who doesn’t know tech? 
    
-   How would you describe DevOps to someone who doesn’t know tech?  
    
    -   Back in the day, technology teams worked separately to solve problems. The teams were divided into two main groups for the most part. One being a team that focused on working with creating and putting together applications and the other team handled the delivery and focused on making sure the application works and how to fix it when it breaks. However, This created a lot of frustration in the workplace because teams ran into problems communicating with each other. However, to fix this problem, DevOps were formed, a combination of the two teams. The DevOps team works together to set up different computers and launch applications without running into the old problems the separate teams faced. DevOps also make sure the applications work and have plans to quickly fix any problems that may occur. This makes the company the teams work for happy because it saves them money and time.
