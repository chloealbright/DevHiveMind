While stories and requirements share some attributes, they inherently differ. Specifications for implementation are often defined at the user story level, emphasizing the need for a high-level and adaptable description that prioritizes the customer's perspective. Notably, these definitions may evolve during discovery.

Key attributes of effective requirements and user stories include:

- **Cohesive:** Pertaining to a single topic, be it a business process, interface, or event. All interconnected requirements should align with and contribute to the same overarching purpose.

- **Complete:** Comprehensive documentation of all essential aspects, ensuring the requirement is self-contained.

- **Consistent:** Avoiding contradictions with other requirements, maintaining a similar level of detail when compared to related requirements.

- **Correct:** Accurately reflecting business needs as specified by the relevant use or subject matter expert.

- **Modifiable:** Organized logically to facilitate changes, as requirements must be adaptable and logically structured.

- **Unambiguous:** Specific and clear, ensuring universal understanding.

- **Feasible:** Realistic and achievable within the given context and constraints.

- **Testable:** Articulated in a manner that allows for testing, ensuring that the requirement can be verified for correct implementation.

Furthermore, it is crucial to note that requirement definitions should generally be high-level descriptions, avoiding excessive detail to accommodate potential changes. This adaptability is especially significant in the dynamic landscape of Agile development.
