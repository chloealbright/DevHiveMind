>[!important] Scrum master is there to address blockers and help move things like reaching out to stakeholders on your behave if they aren't helping you out  with what you need. 

The flow from themes to epics to features to user stories can vary depending on the specific project management or development framework being used. However, there are commonly accepted practices in many agile methodologies the typical flow is from:

1. **Themes:** High-level business objectives or goals.
2. **Epics:** Large, high-level entities that represent big, overarching initiatives or goals. Epics are usually too broad to be completed in a single iteration or sprint.
3. **Features:** Epics are decomposed into features, which are more manageable and focused units of work. Features are still relatively high-level and may take several sprints to complete.
4. **User Stories:** Features, in turn, are broken down into user stories. User stories are more granular, detailed, and focused on a specific functionality or requirement and written from the user's perspective. They are the smallest units of work that can be completed within a single sprint.

## **User Stories Intricacies:**

User stories may engage various stakeholders, leading to diverse or misaligned acceptance criteria.

User stories are also be written across multiple personas, exemplified by Persona like this:

*As Persona A:*
I want to [specific action or feature]  
So that [desired outcome or benefit]

*As Persona B:*
I want to [specific action or feature]  
So that [desired outcome or benefit]

*As Persona C:*
I want to [specific action or feature]  
So that [desired outcome or benefit]


# **Themes In-Depth**

- Themes are large, overarching objectives or focus areas that help align the development efforts with strategic business goals.
- A theme is a collection of related user stories and features that contribute to achieving a specific business objective or solving a particular problem.
- Themes provide a way to group and prioritize [[Business Requirements Life cycle | Business requirements]] based on the strategic goals of the organization. They are often used in the higher-level planning of the product roadmap.


# Features In-Depth   

Features represent overarching changes aimed at enhancing customer experience and typically have a timeframe of less than a year. This hierarchical breakdown involves dividing them into 3-month Epics, further decomposed into small user stories aligned with 2-week sprints for team-based development. The progression from feature to epic to story to UML to code defines the iterative development process.

- **Understanding Themes:**
  - Epics align with themes, requiring a comprehensive grasp of overarching concepts, such as a bank and finance system. Completed epics, serving as a culmination of stories, are then transformed into features aligned with predefined themes.

- **Definition of Success:**
  - Success is gauged by evaluating if anyone else is pursuing a similar objective. Definitions are aligned and potentially refined to ensure clarity and unified understanding.

# Epics In-Depth 

OKR are converted into epics and have a theme

Epic has acceptance criteria

Features are detailed and programmable

Epics can be 1 sprint at minimum or 2 weeks or can span across all 6 sprint within a Quarter 

so 1 quarter has 6 sprints or 12 weeks then PI plaining for next Quater with 6 sprints

you can combine epics, have it roll over into another sprint 

stories need to be closed in order to close epics 

and epics might be created at the product group level

Martha Shipra and Wendy have epics in general anybody can have one but they Just specifically have one

>[!note] There will be a continuous improvement epic that you may be creating a story for improving something that exists 

# Shirt/sprint size 

XS less then 1 sprint or 2 weeks should considered weather this is a story then an epic 

S 1 to 2 sprints about a month  

M 2 to 4 sprints or 1 to 2 months 

L 4 to 5 sprints or 2 to 3 months  

XXL or XL greater then 5 to 6 sprints and should be considered to be broken into 2 epics 

# Split a Story 

Story has multiple items (words such as "and" or "or" appear  

- All of these conditions necessary right now? 

Too many workflow steps for user  

- Are all these steps necessary right now? 

Happy path Vs alternative paths  

- Are all the alternative flows necessary right now? 

Operations based story 

- Are all the operations necessary right now? 

Acceptance Criteria  

- Different stories to handle different scenarios  -All test scenarios necessary right now? 

Variations in Data/Interfaces/Platforms  

- Are all these options necessary right now? 

Use cases are scenarios where you represent multiple parties that have to be involved or maybe involved  

	You have two types of relationship extend where maybe additional behaviors added   And include which is The baseline relationship  
	
	Stories focus on the who, what, and why while use cases are more detailed include process flows for users with in depth guidance

Purpose of stories create a persona in an arbitrary situation where that persona is hitting multiple touch points within the story with a product of some sort example   

As persona Joe I need / want this feature so I can.. business benefit and effect   

As a user, I want to be able to set reminders to take my medications or supplements so that I don't forget to take them. 

Story consist of Acceptance criteria which is a checklist of key things to provide a better understanding of boundaries and behavior of the story And test scenarios where you can validate the story has been delivered correctly
